	[c dimgray]The Story of Anthia and Habrocomes[/c][c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] attributed to Xenophon
	of Ephesus resembles the other four extant Greek
	romantic novels in featuring invented (not mythical or historical)
	characters in a plot centered on a boy and a girl
	who fall in love, remain true to one another despite obstacles,
	threats, temptations, and separations, and, by virtue
	of their own goodness and the grace of friendly deities, live
	happily ever after. In contrast to earlier Greek literature,
	where erotic relationships are unequal in terms of age and
	power, relationships and initiatives in the novels are more
	equal and reciprocal, and marriage, the ultimate goal and
	ideal, is based on romantic love and fidelity on the part of
	both partners.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The Suda and F, our only independent MS, entitle the novel
	[c dimgray]The Ephesian Story of Anthia and Abrocomes[/c] (for the most part F
	also uses this spelling in the text), while Gregory Pardus (c. 1070–1156)
	cites it as [c dimgray]The Story of Habrocomes and Anthia[/c]. Because the
	form  ta kata/peri + girl’s (or girl’s + boy’s) name(s) is common to
	the titles of all five extant romantic novels but toponymic
	descriptors (three different ones in the case of Longus) are not, I
	assume that the former was the original and generic form. And because
	“Abrocomes” is meaningless in Greek, I adopt the aspirated
	form of the name (“Graceful-Haired”), which is normal from classical
	through imperial times.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	X.’s novel, like [c dimgray]The Story of Callirhoe[/c] by Chariton
	of Aphrodisias, represents a “presophistic” mode of the
	genre, lacking the refinements of language, style, structure,
	narrative, rhetoric, literary allusion, and intertextuality
	that characterize the novels by Longus, Achilles Tatius,
	and Heliodorus. In terms of sophistication X. is indeed
	closer to [c dimgray]The Story of Apollonius of Tyre[/c] than to [c dimgray]Callirhoe[/c],
	with some features more characteristic of oral storytelling
	and folktale than of literature. His language is simple,
	straightforward, and formulaic, an archaizing but unsystematic
	Attic that does not completely cover a [c dimgray]koine[/c]
	base and pays less attention to such niceties as connection,
	subordination, rhythm, and avoidance of hiatus than
	in the other novelists. His narrative is rapid, paratactic, and
	schematic, with much repetition and parallelism but without
	large-scale shaping. Although he has literary interests
	(Herodotus, Xenophon, Thucydides, epic, drama, oratory,
	travel writing, geography, and mythography), there is no
	overt literary allusion or intertextual play, no mythological
	characters or situations, no artistic, philosophical, scientific,
	didactic, or sententious enhancements, and very little
	rhetorical ornamentation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What X. gives us is not literature but action and adventure,
	in a form not unlike a screenplay for a television serial
	or action movie, or a graphic novel. The characters are
	functional, defined simply as good or bad of their type, motivated
	by basic and melodramatic emotions, and without
	moral or psychological depth. The focus is not so much on
	the overall plot as on the individual scenes and episodes,
	which are developed for their own interest and strung
	together with minimal, sometimes no, motivation, often
	simply a decision by a character, and with no great concern

	[c darkmagenta][b]XENOPHON OF EPHESUS, The Story of Anthia and Habrocomes[/b][/c]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	for smooth transitions and logical consistency. There is less
	direct speech (under a third of the whole) than in the other
	novels but, despite the work’s relative brevity, far more
	episodes and subplots, some of them developed for their
	own interest, and an unusually large number of characters,
	no fewer than 44, 33 of whom are given names. The premium
	is on incidental vividness and variety, on suspense
	and surprise, so that from a literary point of view the novel
	looks uneven and ill-proportioned, some episodes and
	characters (especially in half of Book II, Book IV, and
	chapters 2–10 of Book V) being less well developed than
	others.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These features have led some to suppose that our text is
	the work of an epitomator, a supposition that suits the
	statement in the Suda, derived from a sixth-century source
	(see below), that the novel was in ten books, not the five
	which our text contains. While this cannot be disproved,
	we need not resort to an epitomator’s intervention to account
	for our text’s language, characterizations, plot, and
	narrative style: they are consistent throughout, and suitably
	effective and entertaining at the level of simple, probably
	orally derived, storytelling. Indeed it is hard to imagine
	that the action-crammed, cinematic story we have was
	originally conceived and composed at twice the length and
	in a more polished style.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nonetheless X.’s novel is a good read: its overall structure,
	designed to accommodate both the basic plot (the
	couple’s separation, quest, and ultimate reunion) and a
	wealth of secondary characters, incidents, and locales, is
	clear and economical, more in the manner of epic than the
	other novels. The protagonists begin their adventures in
	Ephesus and share the same cyclic and clockwise route
	through Ionia and the islands (notably Rhodes), Asia,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 202[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	Egypt, Sicily, Italy, and then back again to Ephesus. From
	the point of their separation the perspective splits and
	broadens as more and more characters and subplots weave
	in and out of the action, until with accelerating pace and
	no little dexterity all the strands are gathered and sorted
	for a satisfyingly dramatic finale. Most of the characters,
	however memorable (e.g. the fierce females who beset
	Habrocomes), have only brief or functional roles, but the
	protagonists and the bandit Hippothous, who becomes
	connected to both of them, are given distinctive personalities:
	Anthia is active and resourceful, Habrocomes passive
	and morose (more a Jason than an Odysseus), and the sexually
	ambivalent Hippothous a complex mixture of good
	breeding and sociopathic violence, cruelty and compassion,
	selfishness and loyalty.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Unlike Chariton, X. sets his story not in the historical
	past but in an indefinite time that feels contemporary,
	though he avoids precise markers, never mentioning actual
	persons or events and identifying institutions and
	places only in vague terms. The names of his characters are
	ordinary or drawn from literature and mythology and seem
	to have no special significance or resonance. His geography
	too seems to be derived from books rather than
	personal experience: places are named but not described
	and are sometimes given defunct or variant identities (e.g.
	“Mazacus” for Mazaca, which had been renamed Caesarea
	under Tiberius; “Nucerium” for Nuceria); some of his itineraries
	are unlikely (e.g. the journey through Egypt in 4.1
	and from Italy to Rhodes in 5.10); and his grasp of local information
	is often fuzzy (e.g. “local shepherds” instead of
	the well-known Boukoloi in 3.12.2; the titles ἄρχων and
	διοικῶν of the same official in 4.2).

	lower, the predicaments of the characters more extreme,
	and the worldview bleaker and more lurid than in
	Chariton, more akin to the realistic-picaresque novel or
	a modern western. And so fidelity and chastity, the only
	sure principles in a treacherous and bewildering world, are
	more central, as is the importance of the gods, without
	whose enmity (Eros) there would be no love and separation
	and without whose miraculous interventions (especially
	by Isis, Nile, and Helius) there would be no happy
	reunion.

	[c dimgray]Summary[/c]
	[c dimgray]Book 1[/c]. Young Habrocomes and fourteen-year-old Anthia,
	each from a leading family of Ephesus, possess nearly divine
	good looks, but Habrocomes is as arrogant as he is
	handsome. His contempt of Eros provokes the god, who
	afflicts Habrocomes and Anthia with mutual passion and,
	even after Habrocomes capitulates and begs the god’s
	forgiveness, determines to punish them. Their concerned
	parents consult Apollo, who responds with an oracle foretelling
	for the children long wandering across the sea and
	much suffering before final redemption by Isis. The parents
	accordingly give them a wedding and send them on a
	honeymoon abroad, and the couple exchange vows of eternal
	fidelity. They sail to Samos and Rhodes, where they
	dedicate a golden panoply to Helius, but as they continue
	their voyage they are captured by Phoenician pirates led
	by Corymbus. On the way to his headquarters, commanded
	by Apsyrtus, Corymbus falls for Habrocomes and
	his friend Euxinus for Anthia. Habrocomes and Anthia
	stall for time.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	[c dimgray]Book 2[/c]. While Habrocomes and Anthia contemplate
	suicide as preferable to surrender, Apsyrtus claims them
	as his share of the booty and takes them as slaves to his estate
	in Tyre. Apsyrtus’ daughter Manto falls for Habrocomes
	and with threats and inducements enlists the aid of
	Anthia, Anthia’s loyal servant Rhoda, and her companion
	Leuco. She also writes a letter to Habrocomes. When he
	rejects her, she tells Apsyrtus that she was raped by Habrocomes,
	who is imprisoned and tortured. Anthia, Rhoda,
	and Leuco are awarded to Manto, now married to her original
	fiancé Moeris, and they all move to Syria, where
	Manto gives Anthia to a goatherd named Lampo, who
	however respects her chastity. Apsyrtus discovers Manto’s
	letter, frees Habrocomes, and appoints him steward of his
	estate. When Moeris falls for Anthia, Manto orders Lampo
	to kill her, but instead he sells her to Cilician merchants.
	They are shipwrecked and Anthia is captured by the bandit
	Hippothous, who plans to sacrifice her to Ares, but she is
	rescued by Perilaus, a peace officer from Tarsus. Perilaus
	pressures Anthia to marry him, but she contrives a delay.
	Meanwhile, Habrocomes has gone off to search for Anthia,
	meets Hippothous, and decides to join with him in hopes
	of finding Anthia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Book 3[/c]. As Hippothous recruits a new band, he tells
	Habrocomes the story of his first love, the boy Hyperanthes,
	and its sad dénouement that set him on his career
	as a bandit. Habrocomes responds with his own story of
	Anthia, and Hippothous promises to help him find her.
	Anthia decides to kill herself rather than marry Perilaus
	and asks a doctor for poison, but he gives her a soporific instead.
	She is given a lavish funeral but is rescued by tomb-robbers,
	who take her to Alexandria and sell her to slave

	dealers. Habrocomes hears about Anthia’s stolen body,
	vows to die as soon as he finds it, and takes off for Alexandria.
	Psammis, an Indian merchant, purchases Anthia,
	who puts him off by claiming to be consecrated to Isis for
	one year. Habrocomes is shipwrecked, captured by bandits,
	and sold as a slave to Araxus, who treats him like a
	son but whose wife Cyno propositions him. Habrocomes
	agrees but reneges when Cyno kills Araxus. Cyno has the
	Prefect of Egypt arrest Habrocomes for the murder.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Book 4[/c]. Hippothous recruits a new band and rampages
	through Syria, Phoenicia, and Egypt. Habrocomes is ordered
	crucified but is rescued by the Nile and Helius, then
	ordered burned but rescued again by the Nile. The Prefect
	returns him to prison pending an investigation. Psammis,
	headed to India with Anthia, stops at Memphis, where
	Anthia asks Isis for help. Hippothous’ band kill Psammis
	and capture Anthia, whom they do not recognize. The Prefect
	frees Habrocomes and crucifies Cyno. Habrocomes
	sets off for Italy. When Anthia kills Anchialus, one of Hippothous’
	men, as he tries to rape her, Hippothous has
	her thrown into a pit with hungry dogs, but the guard
	Amphinomus falls for Anthia and keeps the dogs at bay.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Book 5[/c]. Habrocomes arrives in Syracuse and joins the
	old fisherman Aegialeus, who has perpetuated a happy
	marriage by mummifying his deceased wife. Amphinomus
	takes Anthia to Coptus while Hippothous’ gang operates
	to the north. Polyidus, a relative of the Prefect charged
	with putting down the bandits, crushes Hippothous’ band
	at Pelusium. Hippothous escapes and heads for Sicily.
	Polyidus captures Amphinomus and Anthia and falls for
	her. When he pressures her in Memphis she takes refuge
	with Isis, then visits the temple of Apis, whose oracle predicts
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 206[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	that she will soon regain Habrocomes. In Alexandria
	Polyidus’ wife Rhenaea beats Anthia and turns her over
	to her slave Clytus with orders to take her to Italy and sell
	her to a pimp. Clytus reluctantly does so in Tarentum, but
	she preserves her virtue by feigning epilepsy. Habrocomes
	sails to Italy and takes work in a quarry. Hippothous marries
	a wealthy old woman who soon dies, leaving him her
	estate, and sails to Italy with a young boy named Cleisthenes
	in search of Habrocomes. Meanwhile, we learn that
	the couple’s parents have died of grief, while Leuco and
	Rhoda have inherited their Syrian masters’ large estate
	and stop at Rhodes en route back to Ephesus. Hippothous
	recognizes Anthia, buys her from the pimp, learns her
	true identity, and tells her of his affection for Habrocomes.
	Habrocomes decides to return to Ephesus, stops at
	Rhodes, and visits the temple of Helius, where he sees a
	dedication in honor of himself and Anthia made by Leuco
	and Rhoda, who meet him there and learn his identity.
	Hippothous and Anthia stop in Rhodes during the festival
	for Helius. Anthia dedicates a lock of hair, which leads to
	her recognition by everyone, Habrocomes being the last
	to hear the news. The couple reunite near the temple of
	Isis, and all sail back to Ephesus, where Habrocomes and
	Anthia honor Artemis and build tombs for their parents,
	while Hippothous builds a tomb on Lesbos for Hyperanthes,
	adopts Cleisthenes, and returns to Ephesus to live
	happily ever after with Habrocomes and Anthia.

	our only testimony for the author:

	δὲ ἐρωτικὰ βιβλία ιʹ περὶ Ἀβροκόμου καὶ Ἀνθίας·

	Story. [c dimgray]It is a love story in ten books about Abrocomes[/c]
	[c dimgray]and Anthia; also[/c] The City of the Ephesians [c dimgray]and[/c]
	[c dimgray]other works[/c].
	Since the Suda also records novels by other Xenophons, a
	[c dimgray]Babylonian Story[/c] by a X. of Antioch and a [c dimgray]Cyprian Story[/c]
	by a X. of Cyprus, it could be that X. was a generic name
	adopted by early novelists (perhaps in homage to X. of
	Athens), and that our X. was Ephesian could be a mere
	inference from the home city of his protagonists and/or the
	novel’s (alternate? cf. n. 1) title, since the text itself contains
	nothing that demonstrates native or even eyewitness
	familiarity with Ephesus. But the mention of other works
	by X., including one about Ephesus, may reflect real information.
	For the number of books, itacism of ε΄(“five”),
	which is the number given in the subscription to F, is a likelier
	explanation of the Suda’s ι΄(“ten”) than the supposition
	that our text is an epitome.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	X.’s vagueness about people, places, and events leaves
	us with no external evidence for dating the novel. If there
	are references to the Prefect of Egypt (but ἄρχων and

	διοικῶν are used of the same person in 4.2) they give only
	a [c dimgray]terminus post quem[/c] in the time of Augustus. Minas as
	currency (3.5) went out of use in the Hellenistic era, but
	X. may not have known or cared. Perilaus is called “the
	head officer of the peace in Cilicia” (2.13) and some have
	thought that he must be an [c dimgray]eirenarch[/c], an office whose
	earliest attestation is (currently) an Ephesian inscription
	from the reign of Trajan (98–117 ce), giving a [c dimgray]terminus
	post quem[/c] in that era. But this is an unlikely inference:
	the [c dimgray]eirenarch[/c] seems to have been only a municipal officer,
	whereas Perilaus apparently has charge of an entire
	region; there had long been other such “officers of the
	peace” in many places; and even if Perilaus was supposed
	to be an [c dimgray]eirenarch[/c], we do not know when or where this
	office originated: that our earliest attestation is Trajanic
	does not mean that the office was created only then, and
	we have no attestation from Cilicia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Internal features, however, suggest a date earlier than
	the mid-first century ce. As already noted, X. and Chariton
	are both “pre-sophistic” writers, and in addition they have
	significant narrative elements in common. Chariton can be
	firmly dated between the second half of the first century
	bce (mention of a Chinese bow and quiver in 6.4.2) and
	c. 150 ce (papyri), and his style, an educated [c dimgray]koine[/c] without
	sophistic features, seems to place him earlier rather than
	later within this time frame; if Persius’ mention (1.134)
	of [c dimgray]Callirhoe[/c] as an example of trivial literature refers to
	Chariton’s novel (the title occurs nowhere else), then it was
	already well known in Neronian Rome. If the narrative
	elements that both novels share is the result of borrowing,
	it is impossible to tell who borrowed from the other: is
	what we find in X. a clumsy borrowing from Chariton or

	something clumsy that Chariton found in X. and improved?
	Or did both draw independently from an existing
	stock of novelistic elements? In any event, it is clear that X.
	and Chariton treat their material, whatever its sources, differently,
	and if overall sophistication is a sign of progress in
	a genre, then X. should be dated earlier than Chariton.

	[c dimgray]Reception[/c]
	No papyri have yet appeared, and although there are elements
	in the other ancient novels as well as Aristaenetus’
	letters (late 5th or early 6th century) and the [c dimgray]Acta Apocrypha[/c]
	that may have been derived from X., they could also
	have come indirectly or from the common stock, so that
	the earliest sure reference is Gregory Pardus (see n. 1
	above and the textual note on 1.1). The 33rd of the novellas
	of Masuccio Salernitano (born Tommaso Guardati) published
	in Naples in 1476 (“Mariotto and Giannozza”) was
	likely drawn from Xenophon’s story of Anthia and Perilaus
	(2.13, 3.8) and through subsequent treatments by Luigi da
	Porto, Matteo Bandello, and Arthur Brooke became the
	basis for Shakespeare’s [c dimgray]Romeo and Juliet[/c]. Politian cites X.
	in his [c dimgray]Miscellaneorum Centuria Prima[/c] (1489). Parts of the
	story survive in oriental and modern Greek versions.

	[c dimgray]The Text[/c]
	The 13th-century manuscript F (Florentinus Laurentianus
	Conv. Soppr. 627), which also contains Chariton,
	Longus, and part of Achilles Tatius, is the sole independent
	witness for X.’s novel. In F, X.’s spelling, forms, and

	well reflect the author’s own usage (see above). The first
	printed edition, with a Latin translation, was that of Antonio
	Cocchi (London, 1726); it was preceded by an Italian
	translation by Antonio Salvini (London, 1723). The
	chapter division traditionally follows the edition by A. von
	Locella (Vienna, 1796), the subchapter division that of
	R. Hercher (Teubner: Leipzig, 1858).

	[b]The Story of Anthia and Habrocomes[/b]
	
	[b]Book I[/b]
	In Ephesus there was a man named Lycomedes,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] one of [c dimgray]1[/c]
	the most powerful people in the city. This Lycomedes and
	his wife Themisto,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] also a local, had a son Habrocomes,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] a
	paragon of handsomeness without precedent in Ionia or
	anywhere else.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. This Habrocomes grew handsomer by
	the day, and his spiritual virtues blossomed along with his
	physical excellences, for he pursued every field of study
	and practiced a variety of arts, and hunting, riding, and
	training with heavy weapons were exercises familiar to
	him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. He was much sought after by all Ephesians and
	by the inhabitants of the rest of Asia as well, and they had
	high hopes that he would be a citizen of distinction. They
	treated the young man like a god, and there were some
	who at the sight of him even bowed down and offered

	4. The young man held a high opinion of himself,
	glorying both in his spiritual accomplishments and even
	more so in his physical beauty. Everything generally reckoned
	fine he despised as inferior, and nothing seen or
	heard seemed to him worthy of Habrocomes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Whenever
	he was told that a boy was handsome or a girl pretty, he
	would mock those who said so for not knowing that he
	alone was handsome. He did not even recognize Eros as a
	god but rejected him wholesale and paid no attention to
	him, holding that no one at all would ever fall in love or
	submit to this god unwillingly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Whenever he saw a shrine
	or statue of Eros he would laugh and declare that he was
	superior to any Eros both in physical beauty and power.
	And that was the case: wherever Habrocomes appeared,
	no statue looked handsome and no picture was admired.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Eros grew furious at this,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] being a competitive god and [c dimgray]2[/c]
	implacable against those who disdain him. He tried to find
	a stratagem to use against the young man, for even to the
	god he looked hard to catch. So he got himself fully armed
	and, equipping himself with a complete arsenal of love potions,
	set forth against Habrocomes.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. A local festival
	for Artemis[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] was underway, and from the city to her shrine,
	a distance of seven stades,[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] all the local girls had to march
	sumptuously adorned, as did all the ephebes[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] who were

	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]The theme of Eros despised was familiar in myth and folktale,
	cf. Euripides’ Hippolytus and Theocritus’ Daphnis.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]The famous story of Acontius and Cydippe (Callimachus
	[c dimgray]Aetia[/c] 3, Ovid [c dimgray]Her.[/c] 20 and 21) is similar.

	enrolled among the ephebes, and he headed the procession.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. For the spectacle there was a large crowd both
	local and visiting, for it was customary at this assemblage to
	find husbands for the girls and wives for the ephebes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The procession marched along in file, first the sacred objects,
	torches, baskets, and incense, followed by horses,
	dogs, and hunting equipment, some of it martial, most of it
	peaceful < . . . > each of the girls was adorned as for a lover.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Heading the line of girls was Anthia,[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] daughter of
	Megamedes and Euippe,[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] locals. Anthia’s beauty was
	marvelous and far surpassed the other girls. She was fourteen,
	her body was blooming with shapeliness, and the
	adornment of her dress enhanced her grace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Her hair
	was blonde, mostly loose, only little of it braided, and moving
	as the breezes took it. Her eyes were vivacious, bright
	like a beauty’s but forbidding like a chaste girl’s; her clothing
	was a belted purple tunic, knee-length and falling loose
	over the arms, and over it a fawnskin with a quiver attached,
	arrows < . . . >, javelins in hand, dogs following behind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Often when seeing her at the shrine, the Ephesians
	worshiped her as Artemis, so also at the sight of her
	on this occasion the crowd cheered; the opinions of the
	spectators were various, some in their astonishment declaring
	that she was the goddess herself, others that she

	was someone else fashioned by the goddess, but all of them
	prayed, bowed down, and congratulated her parents, and
	the universal cry among all the spectators was “Anthia the
	beautiful!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. As the crowd of girls passed by, no one said
	anything but “Anthia,” but as soon as Habrocomes followed
	with the ephebes, as lovely as the spectacle of the
	girls had been, at the sight of Habrocomes they all forgot
	about them and turned their gaze to him, stunned at
	the sight and shouting “Handsome Habrocomes! Peerless
	likeness of a handsome god!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. And now some added,
	“What a match Habrocomes and Anthia would make!”
	These were opening moves in Eros’ stratagem. They were
	both quickly aware of each other’s reputation; Anthia
	longed to see Habrocomes and Habrocomes, hitherto insensible
	to love, wanted to see Anthia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so when the procession was over, the whole crowd [c dimgray]3[/c]
	repaired to the shrine for the sacrifice, the order of the
	procession was dissolved, and men and women, ephebes
	and girls, gathered in the same spot. There they saw each
	other. Anthia was captivated by Habrocomes, and Habrocomes
	was bested by Eros. He kept gazing at the girl and
	though he tried, he could not take his eyes off her: the god
	pressed his attack and held him fast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Anthia too was in a
	bad way, as with eyes wide open she took in Habrocomes’
	handsomeness as it flowed into her, already putting maidenly
	decorum out of her mind: for what she said was for
	Habrocomes to hear, and she uncovered what parts of
	her body she could for Habrocomes to see. He gave himself
	over to the sight and fell captive to the god.

	4. It was when each had come
	home that they realized what trouble had befallen them.
	For both of them the image of the other kept coming to
	mind, love flared up inside them, and having stoked their
	desire for the rest of the day, at bedtime they were in dire
	straits, and the love in each of them was uncontrollable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Habrocomes pulled his hair and ripped his clothes. [c dimgray]4[/c]
	“What troubles I have!” he exclaimed, “What bad luck!
	Until now Habrocomes was manly, contemptuous of Eros,
	a maligner of the god, and now I’m caught, vanquished,
	forced to be a girl’s slave. As there now seems to be someone
	better looking than me, I acknowledge Eros as a god.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Wait: what an utterly worthless coward I am! Will I not
	resist this time? Will I not stand firm? Will I not remain
	stronger than Eros? It’s time that I defeated this no-account
	god.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. A girl is beautiful, but what of it? It’s in your
	eyes, Habrocomes, that Anthia is attractive, not in your
	heart, if only you have the will. Let this be your decision:
	Eros shall never vanquish me!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. At these words the god
	attacked him more determinedly, dragging him along as
	he resisted and tormenting him as he balked. When he
	could hold out no longer, he threw himself to the ground
	and cried, “You win, Eros! Here stands your great trophy
	over Habrocomes the Chaste. He is your suppliant.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Now
	rescue one who takes refuge with you, the master of the
	universe! Don’t abandon me or punish my rashness any
	further. It was through inexperience, Eros, that I scorned
	your powers. But now please give me Anthia! Don’t be only

	a harsh god toward the gainsayer but also a benefactor to
	the vanquished.” This was his prayer, but Eros was still angry
	and determined to think of a great punishment to visit
	on Habrocomes for his scorn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Anthia too was in a bad
	way: no longer able to bear it, she collected herself as she
	tried to hide her condition from those around her. “What is
	wrong with me?” she said, “I’m an underage maiden in
	love, and I hurt in ways strange and inappropriate for a girl.
	I’m crazy for Habrocomes, who is handsome but arrogant.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Where is the limit of my desire, and where is the end of
	my suffering? The one I love is haughty, and I am a maiden
	kept under surveillance. What helper can I find? To whom
	can I confide this? Where can I see Habrocomes?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Each of them spent the whole night lamenting this way, [c dimgray]5[/c]
	and they held before their eyes the sight of the other as
	they refashioned their mental images of one another. Next
	day, Habrocomes went to his accustomed exercises and the
	girl went as usual to serve the cult of the goddess.

	2. Their
	bodies were tired out after the previous night, their eyes
	listless, and their complexions altered, and this continued
	for quite a while with no change in their situation.

	3. In
	the meantime, they spent their days watching each other
	in the goddess’s temple, in their embarrassment fearful of
	telling each other the truth. Habrocomes went so far as
	moaning, weeping, and praying in pitiful fashion within earshot
	of the girl,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. while Anthia felt the same way but was
	more deeply afflicted: whenever she spotted other girls or

	was visibly distressed, in fear of being outclassed. Each

	longer: already his physique had vanished entirely and his
	mind had collapsed. Lycomedes and Themisto were considerably
	depressed, not knowing what had happened to
	Habrocomes but frightened by what they saw.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Megamedes
	and Euippe had become equally frightened about
	Anthia as they saw her beauty fading away without an apparent
	reason for her affliction. Finally they brought in
	seers and priests to Anthia to find relief from her terrible
	state.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Upon arrival they sacrificed victims, made various
	libations, uttered exotic words to placate, so they said,
	certain divinities, and pretended that her terrible state
	came from the underworld gods.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. Lycomedes’ household
	also made plenty of sacrifices and prayers for Habrocomes,
	but there was no relief for either of them from their terrible
	state, but their love burned even stronger.

	9. Both lay
	sick, in a condition so critical that they were expected
	to die at any moment, unable to acknowledge what was
	wrong. Finally their fathers sent a delegation to the god’s
	shrine to have the cause and the cure of the sickness divined.

	Why do you long to discover the end and the start of

	Both are in thrall to one illness, and thence must the
	cure be accomplished.
	Terrible their sufferings I can foresee and toils never-ending.
	Both will take flight o’er the sea, pursued by a frenzy
	of madness;
	Chains will they bear at the hands of men who
	consort with the ocean,
	And one tomb and annihilating fire will be their
	nuptial bower.
	Yet in time, when their sufferings are over, a happier

	When this response was brought to Ephesus, their fathers [c dimgray]7[/c]
	were immediately at a loss, had no idea what the danger
	was, and could not understand the god’s utterance:
	what was the illness? the flight? the chains? the tomb? the

	they decided to take as encouraging a view of the oracle
	as possible and join the children in marriage, since the

	the city was full of revelers, everything was festooned with
	garlands, and the impending wedding was much ballyhooed.
	Everyone saw a blessed future for him in marrying
	such a wife and for her in sharing her bed with such a
	young man.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When Habrocomes found out about the
	prophecy and the wedding, he was overjoyed at the prospect
	of marrying Anthia and the prophecies did not scare
	him at all: his present situation seemed nicer than any danger.
	Anthia took the same delight at the prospect of marrying
	Habrocomes: she paid no attention to what the flight or
	the disasters might be, since she had Habrocomes as a consolation
	for all future ills.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so the time for their wedding arrived. There were [c dimgray]8[/c]
	nightlong revels and many sacrifices to the goddess, and
	when these were performed and evening had come,
	though to Habrocomes and Anthia everything seemed to
	take too long, they escorted the girl to the bridal chamber
	with torches, singing the bridal hymn and shouting blessings,
	took her inside, and put her on the bed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The chamber
	had been prepared for them: a golden bed had been
	spread with purple sheets, and above the bed a Babylonian
	canopy had been finely embroidered: there were Cupids at
	play, some attending Aphrodite, who was also represented,
	some riding mounted on sparrows, some plaiting garlands,
	some bearing flowers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. These were on one part of the
	canopy; on the other was Ares, not armed but garlanded
	and wearing a fine cloak, dressed for his lover Aphrodite;
	Eros, holding a lighted torch, was leading him on his way.
	Under the canopy itself they brought Anthia to Habrocomes,
	put her on the bed, and closed the doors.

	pleasure, shy, fearful, breathing hard; their bodies were
	trembling and their hearts quivering.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. At last Habrocomes
	recovered and embraced Anthia, and she started to
	cry as her heart itself poured forth the tears that were signs
	of her desire. Habrocomes sighed, “Ah night that I have
	most longed for and that was so hard to attain, after many
	previous nights in pain! Girl sweeter to me than the light of
	day, and luckier than any girl they talk about in stories, you
	have your lover as a husband: may it be yours to live and die
	with him as a chaste wife.” With these words he kissed her
	and caught her tears, and he thought her tears sweeter to
	drink than any nectar and more potent against pain than
	any drug.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. She spoke few words to him: “Truly, Habrocomes,
	do I look beautiful to you? Do I please you even after
	your own good looks? Unmanly coward, how long did
	you delay your love? How long did you neglect it? I know
	from my own ills what you suffered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Here, catch my
	tears and let your beautiful hair drink a draught of love,
	let’s cling together and become one, let’s drench our garlands
	with each other’s tears so that they too can share in
	our love.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. With these words she pressed his whole face
	close, put all of his hair against her own eyes, took the garlands
	in her hands, and locked her lips on his in a kiss,
	and all their thoughts passed through their lips from one’s
	heart to the other’s.

	7. As she kissed his eyes she said,

	now, you have served me well, and well have you guided
	my love into Habrocomes’ heart.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. For that I give you lots
	of kisses and join to you my own eyes, the servants of
	Habrocomes. May you always see just what you see now
	and not show Habrocomes any other beautiful girl, and
	may no other man appear good-looking to me. Own the
	hearts that you yourselves set afire, and look after them
	both alike.”

	9. With these words they relaxed in close embrace
	and for the first time enjoyed the gifts of Aphrodite,
	and all night long they competed with each other, ambitious
	to be revealed as the one more in love.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The next day, they arose much happier and in much [c dimgray]10[/c]
	better spirits, now that they had enjoyed what they had for
	a long time desired from one another.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Their whole life
	was a festival, everything was full of enjoyment, and even
	the oracle was already forgotten. But fate had not forgotten,
	nor did the god neglect what he had decided.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. A short while later, the fathers resolved to send them away
	from the city according to plan; they would see another
	country and other cities and soften the god’s oracle, as far
	as they could, by being away from Ephesus for a time.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So
	everything was made ready for their departure: there was a
	large ship with a crew ready to sail, provisions were put
	on board, lots of clothing of various kinds, lots of silver
	and gold, and an excessive abundance of food.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Before
	their departure there were sacrifices for Artemis, prayers
	from the entire citizenry, and tears from everyone as if
	they were about to be separated from their own children.
	The voyage prepared for them was to Egypt.

	day came for their departure, many servants and maids
	<were put aboard>, and as the ship made ready to sail, the
	whole Ephesian populace was on hand to send them off,
	including many <foreigners> with torches and sacrifices.

	7. Meanwhile Lycomedes and Themisto, remembering
	everything at once, the oracle, their child, the trip, lay
	prostrate in despair, while Megamedes and Euippe had
	the same experience but were in better spirits, since they
	focused on the oracle’s final outcome.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. Then the crew was
	bustling, the mooring cables were released, the pilot took
	his position, and the ship was under way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. The cry from
	those on shore was loud and was joined by those aboard the
	ship: “Dear children, are we your parents going to see you
	again?” and“Fathers, are we going to have you back?”
	There were tears and lamentation, with each loudly calling
	to a loved one by name, leaving one another their names
	to remember.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. Megamedes picked up a bottle, poured
	a libation, and prayed audibly to those aboard the ship:
	“Children, may you have the very best of luck and escape
	the harsh terms of the oracle, may the Ephesians welcome
	you back safely, and may you regain your beloved homeland!
	If anything else should happen, know that we will not
	continue to live either; we are sending you away on a journey
	that is unfortunate but necessary.”

	Tears began to flow and prevented him from saying any [c dimgray]11[/c]
	more. They returned to the city as the crowd tried to console
	them, while Habrocomes and Anthia lay in a close embrace
	with much on their minds—pity for their fathers,
	homesickness for their country, worry about the oracle,

	2. Having a favoring wind that day, they completed the first
	stage of their journey and put in to Samos, the sacred island
	of Hera, where they made sacrifice and had a meal,
	and after many prayers to the goddess they set forth again
	the next evening.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Again the sailing was favorable, and
	they had many conversations: “Will we be allowed to spend
	our lives together?” Then Habrocomes groaned deeply as
	he recalled his own situation and said, “Anthia, dearer to
	me than my own life, my fondest hope is that together we
	will be happy and safe,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. but if fate has some misfortune in
	store and we are somehow separated, let’s take an oath,
	dearest, that you will stay chaste for me and submit to
	no other man, and that I will live with no other woman.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. When she heard this, Anthia shrieked and said, “What
	are you saying, Habrocomes? How can you believe that if I
	am separated from you I would ever think about marrying
	a man, when I won’t even stay alive without you? So I swear
	to you by our ancestral goddess, the great Artemis of the
	Ephesians, and by this sea that we are crossing, and by the
	god who has happily made us mad for each other that
	should I be separated from you even for the briefest moment,
	I will not continue to live or look upon the sun.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. This was Anthia’s oath, and Habrocomes made an oath
	too, and the circumstances made their oaths the more formidable.
	Meanwhile the ship passed by Cos and Cnidus,
	and the large island of Rhodes was coming into view; there
	they had to disembark completely, for the crew said that

	on a long sailing.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ship put in to Rhodes and the crew disembarked; [c dimgray]12[/c]
	Habrocomes left the ship too, holding Anthia by the hand.
	All the Rhodians gathered round, amazed at the youngsters’
	beauty, and not one of those who saw them passed
	by in silence: some called them a divine visitation, others
	worshiped and bowed before them. The names of Habrocomes
	and Anthia quickly made their way throughout
	the city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They were accorded public prayers, and the
	Rhodians offered many a sacrifice and celebrated their
	visit like a festival. They toured the whole city and in the
	temple of Helius[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] dedicated a golden panoply and had an
	inscription from its donors inscribed on a plaque:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The visitors dedicated to you these weapons of
	beaten gold,
	Anthia and Habrocomes, citizens of sacred Ephesus.
	3. When they had made this dedication and spent a few
	days on the island, at the crew’s urging they took on supplies
	and set sail, and the entire Rhodian populace saw
	them off. At first they were carried along by a favoring
	wind and they found their journey pleasant, and that day
	and the following night they were carried along as they
	took the measure of the so-called Egyptian Sea. But by the
	next day the wind had dropped, there was a calm, their
	progress was slow, and among the crew there was relaxation,
	drinking, drunkenness, and a start of what had been
	prophesied.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. At this point Habrocomes had a vision of a

	large, and wearing scarlet clothing, and as she stood
	over him she appeared to set the ship afire; everyone perished
	while he swam to safety with Anthia. He was instantly
	shaken up by this vision and expected something
	terrible to come of this dream, and this terrible something
	did come to pass.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It so happened that in Rhodes some pirates of Phoenician [c dimgray]13[/c]
	Origin[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] were moored alongside them in a great trireme;
	they moored there as if carrying cargo and were a
	large and lusty lot. They discovered that there was gold, silver,
	slaves, and many valuable goods aboard the adjoining
	ship.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So they decided to attack, killing any who fought back
	and taking the rest to Phoenicia to sell along with the goods,
	but they thought little of them as opponents.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The leader
	of the pirates was called Corymbus,[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] a large young man
	with a fearsome glance, whose hair hung loose and unkempt.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When the pirates had settled on this plan, they first
	sailed quietly alongside Habrocomes’ crew, but when it was
	midday and everyone on board lay about either sleeping or
	befuddled in the aftermath of carefree drinking, Corymbus’
	men finally attacked with their ship going full speed ahead.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. As they drew near, they boarded the ship fully armed and
	with swords drawn; some on the ship threw themselves
	overboard in panic and drowned, while others, ready to defend
	themselves, were slaughtered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Habrocomes and
	Anthia ran up to the pirate Corymbus, grasped him by his
	knees, and said, “Take the cargo, master, and take us as slaves,
	but spare our lives and stop killing those who willingly surrender

	please don’t, but take us wherever you like, sell us as your own
	slaves, only take pity on us and give us to a single master.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At this Corymbus immediately ordered his men to stop [c dimgray]14[/c]
	the slaughter, transferred the most valuable cargo, including
	Habrocomes and Anthia and a few of the servants, and
	set the ship afire; everyone else was burned alive, since
	he could not transport them all and considered it unsafe.

	2. It was a sad spectacle, some being brought aboard the
	trireme while the others, stretching out their hands and
	wailing, were burned alive on the ship.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The former were
	asking, “Where in the world are you being taken, masters?
	What land will receive you, in what city will you live?”
	The others were saying, “Blessed are those who will be
	lucky enough to die before they endure chains, before
	they know enslavement to brigands!” With this, the former
	were carried off while the latter were burned alive.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Meanwhile, Habrocomes’ tutor, already an elderly man
	venerable in appearance and pitiful in his old age, was unable
	to bear Habrocomes’ abduction, threw himself overboard,
	and swam after the trireme crying, “Why, my child,
	are you abandoning your old pedagogue?

	5. Where are you
	headed, Habrocomes? Kill this unfortunate with your own
	hands and bury me, for what is life to me without you?”
	With these words he finally lost hope of seeing Habrocomes
	again, surrendered himself to the waves, and died.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. For Habrocomes too this was sadder than anything else,
	and so he kept stretching out his hands to the elderly man
	and imploring the pirates to pull him aboard, but they paid

	7. They
	brought them not into the city itself but to a nearby spot
	that was home to the leader of the gang, whose name was
	Apsyrtus,[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] to whom even Corymbus was subordinate, for
	a wage and a share of the booty. During the course of the
	voyage Corymbus fell passionately in love with Habrocomes
	from seeing him so often every day, and being at
	close quarters with the boy inflamed him all the more.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	During the voyage he thought it impossible to seduce [c dimgray]15[/c]
	him, since he saw how wretchedly off he was from despair
	and also saw that he was in love with Anthia; and then again
	it seemed to him difficult to resort to force, since he was
	afraid that Habrocomes might do himself some injury.

	control himself. He began by taking care of Habrocomes,
	encouraging him to take heart and offering him every attention,

	3. but he thought it was out of pity that Corymbus
	was showing him attention. Next, Corymbus confided his
	love to one of his fellow pirates, Euxinus[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] by name, and
	asked him to be his helper and advise him about how he
	could seduce the young man.

	4. Euxinus was pleased to
	hear about Corymbus’ situation because he himself was in
	a wretched state over Anthia and bore a fearsome passion
	for the girl, so he told Corymbus about his own situation
	and advised him to stop torturing himself and seize the initiative.

	5. “Look,” he said, “it would be very abject of us to
	run risks and put ourselves in harm’s way without confidently
	enjoying what we have won by our efforts. We will
	be able to get them,” he said, “as our share from Apsyrtus,
	as a gift.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6.With this he easily convinced him, lovelorn as
	he was, and so they agreed to put in the same good word for
	each other, Euxinus to win over Habrocomes and Corymbus,
	Anthia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Meanwhile <the couple> lay disheartened, beset by [c dimgray]16[/c]
	worries, as they talked with one another and constantly
	vowed to uphold their agreement.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Corymbus and
	Euxinus approached them and, explaining that they
	wanted a private word, Corymbus took Anthia aside while
	Euxinus took Habrocomes. Their hearts were pounding
	and they suspected nothing wholesome.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Euxinus duly
	spoke to Habrocomes on behalf of Corymbus: “Young
	man, it is only natural to take this disaster hard, now that
	you are a slave and no longer a master, a pauper and no
	longer rich, but you should chalk it all up to fortune, be
	content with your dominant fate, and show affection for
	your new masters.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Let me tell you that you can recover
	your happiness and freedom if you’re willing to obey your
	master, Corymbus, because he’s passionately in love with
	you and ready to make you master of all he possesses.
	Nothing bad will happen to you, and you will make your
	master better disposed toward you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Reflect on your circumstances:
	there’s no one to help you, this is a barbarian
	land, your masters are bandits, and there’s no escape from
	retribution should you treat Corymbus with disdain. Why
	do you need a wife and responsibilities now? Why should
	someone your age need to love a woman? Toss all that

	obedience when he has given an order.”

	6. At this Habrocomes
	was struck speechless and could find nothing at
	all to say in response, but burst into tears and groaned as
	he contemplated what he had truly come to. And so he
	said to Euxinus, “Please, master, give me a little time to
	think it over, and I will respond to everything you said.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Euxinus went away as Corymbus finished telling Anthia
	about Euxinus’ love, her present constraint, and how she
	should obey her masters completely. He made a lot of
	promises if she obeyed: lawful marriage, money, prosperity.
	But she gave him the same answer as Habrocomes,
	asking for a little time to think it over. So Euxinus and
	Corymbus both started waiting to hear something, but
	they expected to win them over easily.

	Habrocomes and Anthia returned to the cubicle where [c dimgray]1[/c]
	they were usually quartered, and when they told each
	other what they had been told, they threw themselves to
	the floor and began to weep and wail.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “Ah father,” they
	cried, “ah mother, dearest homeland, household, and family!”
	Habrocomes finally pulled himself together and said,
	“We are so unfortunate! What will happen to us, now in a
	barbarian land and turned over to wanton pirates? The
	prophecies begin to come true. Now the god is working his
	vengeance on me for my arrogance: Corymbus is in love
	with me, and Euxinus with you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. How untimely is our
	beauty for both of us! Is it for this that until now I have kept
	myself chaste, only to submit to the sordid lust of an amorous
	pirate? And what sort of life lies ahead for me, once I
	become a whore instead of a man and lose my own Anthia?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. No, I swear by the chastity that has been my companion
	since childhood that I will not submit to Corymbus! I will
	die first and be revealed chaste even as a corpse!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. With
	this he burst into tears, and Anthia said, “We’re in such
	trouble! How soon we are forced to remember our oaths,
	how soon tested by slavery! Someone loves me and expects
	to seduce me and join me in my own bed after Habrocomes,
	to sleep with me and indulge his desire.

	I never be so fond of life, may I never survive to look upon
	the sun if I am violated. Let this be our decision: that we
	die, Habrocomes. After death we will have each other and
	be molested by no one.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And that was their decision. Meanwhile Apsyrtus, the [c dimgray]2[/c]
	leader of the gang, heard that Corymbus’ men had returned
	with a lot of marvelous booty and went to their
	place. When he saw Habrocomes’ group he was astounded
	by their good looks, and right away recognizing a large
	profit he claimed them for himself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The rest of the
	money, goods, and girls that had been captured he distributed
	to Corymbus’ men. Euxinus and Corymbus surrendered
	Habrocomes’ group to Apsyrtus unwillingly, but under
	compulsion nevertheless surrendered them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. They
	took their leave, while Apsyrtus seized Habrocomes and
	Anthia along with two slaves, Leuco and Rhoda,[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] and took
	them into Tyre.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The procession drew everyone’s gaze,
	and all were struck by their beauty; barbarian people who
	had never before seen such good looks thought that they
	were looking at gods and congratulated Apsyrtus on possessing
	such slaves.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. He brought them into his house and
	handed them over to a trusty slave, with instructions to
	take good care of them, since he expected a large profit if
	he could sell them for what they were worth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so this was the predicament of Habrocomes’ [c dimgray]3[/c]
	group. A few days later Apsyrtus left for Syria on another
	venture, while his daughter, named Manto,[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] fell in love
	with Habrocomes. She was beautiful and already of marriageable
	age but far behind Anthia in beauty.

	Manto was captivated through daily contact with Habrocomes,
	was uncontrollably smitten, and did not know what
	to do about it. She dared not tell Habrocomes, knowing
	that he had a wife and never expecting to seduce him, nor
	tell anyone else in her circle, for fear of her father.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. All
	this made her burn even hotter, and she was in a bad way.
	When she could contain herself no longer, she decided to
	confess her love to Rhoda, Anthia’s companion and a girl
	her own age, expecting that she alone would help her
	achieve what she desired.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So taking advantage of some
	free time, she took her to the household’s ancestral shrine,
	asked her not to betray a secret, made her swear to it, confessed
	her love for Habrocomes, begged her to assist, and
	promised a great deal for her assistance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. “Be aware,” she
	said, “that you are my slave, and be aware that you will taste
	the wrath of a barbarian if she is wronged.” With this she
	dismissed Rhoda, who found herself in an impossible dilemma:
	being devoted to Anthia, she could not bring herself
	to tell Habrocomes, but she was terrified of the barbarian
	girl’s wrath.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. So she decided that it would be well to
	share Manto’s revelation with Leuco first: Rhoda had a
	special relationship with Leuco, and they were still intimate
	with each other in Tyre.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. So she found him alone
	and said, “Leuco, it’s all over for us: we are about to lose
	our companions. Our master Apsyrtus’ daughter is passionately
	in love with Habrocomes and threatens terrible
	treatment for us unless she gets her way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. So consider
	what we should do: opposing the barbarian girl is dangerous,
	but parting Habrocomes from Anthia is impossible.”

	expected this would lead to great calamities. But at last he
	pulled himself together and said, “Hush, Rhoda: I’ll take
	care of everything.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With this he went to Habrocomes, who had no concern [c dimgray]4[/c]
	beyond his love for Anthia and hers for him, talking to her
	and listening to her talk, and when he was with them he
	asked, “What are we going to do, my friends? What is our
	plan, my fellow slaves?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Habrocomes, one of our masters
	finds you handsome; Apsyrtus’ daughter is in a bad way
	over you, and opposing an amorous barbarian girl is difficult.
	So it’s up to you to think of a plan and rescue us all,
	and not stand by while we fall victim to the wrath of masters.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When Habrocomes heard this he was immediately
	consumed by anger. He looked straight at Leuco and said,
	“You scum, more barbaric than these Phoenicians! How
	dare you speak this way to Habrocomes, and tell me about
	another girl in Anthia’s presence?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. I am a slave, but I
	know how to keep promises. They have power over my
	body, but I keep a free soul. Let Manto threaten me this
	very moment if she likes, with swords, nooses, fire, and
	anything that a slave’s body can bear, because I will never
	willingly agree to do Anthia wrong!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. That was his reply,
	but Anthia sat dumbfounded by her despair and unable
	to say a word. At last she roused herself and said, “I have
	your affection, Habrocomes, and I am convinced that I am
	uniquely cherished by you. But please, master of my heart,
	do not betray yourself, do not succumb to barbarian wrath,
	but acquiesce in your mistress’ desire.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. As for me, I will
	get out of your way by killing myself. Only this will I ask
	of you: bury me with your own hands, give me a kiss as
	I lie there, and remember Anthia.” All this cast Habrocomes

	into greater despair, and he had no idea what he
	should do.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the meantime, as Rhoda delayed, Manto could no [c dimgray]5[/c]
	longer hold out and wrote a letter to Habrocomes containg
	the following message: “To the handsome Habrocomes
	from your mistress, greetings. Manto is in love with you
	and no longer able to stand it: unseemly perhaps for a girl,
	but compulsory for a girl in love. I beg you not to disdain or
	mistreat the girl who has taken your side,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. for if you say
	yes, I will convince my father Apsyrtus to betroth me to
	you, we will get rid of your present wife, and you will be
	rich and prosperous; but if you say no, think what will happen
	to you when the mistreated girl takes her revenge, and
	what will happen to those who abetted your own arrogance.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. She took this letter, sealed it, and gave it to one
	of her barbarian servants, telling her to deliver it to Habrocomes.
	He received it, read it, and was distressed by everything
	it contained; the part about Anthia pained him the
	most.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He kept the tablet, wrote on another one,[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] and
	gave it to the servant; what he wrote was as follows: “Mistress,
	do what you will and use my body as that of a slave; if
	you wish to kill me, I am ready, and if you wish to apply
	your choice of torture, then use torture. But I could not
	come to your bed and I would not consent to such a thing if
	you ordered it.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. When she received this reply Manto
	flew into an uncontrollable rage, and in a confusion of
	emotions of every kind—envy, jealousy, pain, fear—she
	set about considering how she would take revenge on the
	one who was scorning her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. At this juncture Apsyrtus returned

	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]The recipient normally erased the writing on the wax- coated tablet ([c dimgray]pinax[/c]) and used the same tablet for the reply; here
	the preservation of the original letter is important for the plot.

	from Syria with a bridegroom from that country for
	his daughter; his name was Moeris.[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] But as soon as he arrived,
	Manto launched her plot against Habrocomes. She
	mussed her hair and tore her clothes, ran to meet her father,
	fell at his knees and said, “Father, have pity on your
	daughter, outraged by a slave!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Your chaste Habrocomes
	tried to deflower me, and he also offended against you by
	declaring his love for me. So you must exact appropriate
	vengeance on him for audacity of such magnitude; otherwise,
	if you mean to deliver your own daughter into the
	hands of the slaves, I will kill myself first.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Apsyrtus heard this he thought she was telling [c dimgray]6[/c]
	the truth. He made no further investigation into what had
	happened but sent for Habrocomes and said, “You brazen
	piece of filth! Did you dare behave insolently to your masters
	and were you ready, slave that you are, to defile a
	maiden? Well, you will not get away with it, because I am
	going to punish you and make your agony an example to
	the other slaves.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. With that, he had no patience for listening
	to a word of explanation and ordered his slaves to
	rip off the young man’s clothes, fetch fire and whips, and
	start beating him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. It was a piteous spectacle: the blows
	disfigured his whole body, unused to servile torments, his
	blood spilled out, and his beauty died away.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Apsyrtus
	also applied fearsome bonds and fire, and visited the worst
	tortures on him, demonstrating to his daughter’s bridegroom
	that he would be marrying a chaste maiden.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Meanwhile Anthia fell at Apsyrtus’ knees and pleaded for
	Habrocomes, but his answer was, “No, on your account he
	will be punished even more, because he wronged you too,

	a married man in love with another woman.” Then he ordered
	them to tie him up and confine him in a dark cell.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so he was bound and confined, and a terrible depression [c dimgray]7[/c]
	overtook him, especially because he could not see
	Anthia. He began to look for numerous ways to kill himself
	but could find none because his guards were numerous.
	Apsyrtus went ahead with his daughter’s wedding and
	the celebration lasted many days.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Anthia’s unhappiness
	was total, and whenever she could persuade the prison
	guards she would secretly visit Habrocomes and bewail
	their predicament.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Preparations were already underway
	for the trip to Syria, and Apsyrtus sent his daughter off with
	plenty of gifts, gave her Babylonian clothing and a generous
	amount of gold and silver, and to his daughter Manto
	made a present of Anthia, Rhoda, and Leuco.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When
	Anthia heard about this and realized that she was to be
	sent to Syria with Manto, she managed to get into the
	prison, embraced Habrocomes, and said, “Master, I am
	being taken to Syria as Manto’s present, delivered into the
	hands of my jealous rival,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. while you languish in prison
	and await a miserable death, with no one even to deck out
	your corpse. But I swear by our mutual guardian spirit that
	I will be yours as long as I live and even if I must die.” With
	this she kissed him, embraced him, clung to his chains, and
	rolled at his feet.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Finally she left the prison, and he threw himself to [c dimgray]8[/c]
	the ground just as he was and began to weep and wail.
	“Dearest father,” he cried, “and mother Themisto! Where
	is the happiness that we once thought was ours in
	Ephesus? Where are Anthia and Habrocomes, the radiant,
	the center of attention, the beautiful? She is gone to some
	faraway land as a captive, while I am bereft of my only consolation

	2. As he was speaking, sleep overtook him and he was
	visited by a dream. He dreamt that he saw his father
	Lycomedes dressed in black clothing, wandering over every
	land and sea, stopping at the prison, freeing him, and
	releasing him from his cell, and that he himself became a
	horse and traveled to many a land in pursuit of a second
	horse, a mare, and finally found that mare and became a
	man again. After this dream he sprang up and was slightly
	more hopeful.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So he remained locked up in prison, while Anthia, [c dimgray]9[/c]
	Leuco, and Rhoda were taken to Syria. When Manto’s
	group arrived in Antioch, where Moeris was from, she still
	bore a grudge against Rhoda as well as hatred for Anthia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. She immediately ordered Rhoda to be put on a boat
	along with Leuco and sold as far away as possible from Syrian
	territory, and her idea for Anthia was that she would go
	with a slave, one of the lowest order to boot, a rustic goatherd,
	thinking that this way she would get her revenge on
	her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. She sent for the goatherd, named Lampo,[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] handed
	over Anthia, told him to make her his wife, and ordered
	him to take her by force if she refused.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So she was taken
	to the country to be with the goatherd, but when she got to
	the place where Lampo grazed his goats, she fell at his
	knees and begged him to take pity on her and to preserve
	her chastity, and she told him who she was, her erstwhile
	high estate, her husband, her captivity. Lampo listened
	and felt pity for the girl, swore that he would surely keep
	her undefiled, and encouraged her to take heart.[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]

	So she was in the country with the shepherd, all the [c dimgray]10[/c]
	while weeping for Habrocomes, while Apsyrtus, searching
	the small room where Habrocomes had lived before
	his punishment, happened upon Manto’s note to Habrocomes,
	recognized the writing, and realized that he was
	punishing Habrocomes unfairly. So he gave immediate orders
	to release him and bring him into his presence.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. A
	victim of cruel and piteous treatment, he fell at Apsyrtus’
	knees, but he made him rise and said, “Take heart, young
	man: I believed a daughter’s allegations and wrongly condemned
	you. But now I will make you a free man instead of
	a slave, I will put you in charge of my own household, and I
	will marry you to a daughter of one of our citizens; for your
	part, bear me no grudge over what happened, because I
	did not mean to wrong you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. To Apsyrtus’ offer Habrocomes
	replied, “You have my gratitude, master, for learning
	the truth and rewarding me for my self-control.” Indeed
	everyone in the household felt glad for Habrocomes
	and expressed their gratitude to the master. But he himself
	remained in deep distress about Anthia, and she was
	always on his mind: “What do I care about freedom? About
	riches and stewardship of Apsyrtus’ possessions? That
	is not what I should be doing; I wish I could find Anthia
	alive or dead!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So this was his situation as he managed
	Apsyrtus’ affairs while pondering when and where he
	would find Anthia. But Leuco and Rhoda had been taken
	to the town of Xanthus in Lycia,[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] an inland town, where
	they were sold to an old man who paid them every attention

	no longer seeing Anthia and Habrocomes pained them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Anthia lived for some time with the goatherd, but [c dimgray]11[/c]
	Manto’s husband Moeris frequently visited the place and
	fell passionately in love with Anthia. At first he tried not to
	show it, but in the end he told the goatherd of his love and
	promised him a lot for his connivance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The goatherd
	came to terms with him, but for fear of Manto he visited
	her and told her about Moeris’ love. She became enraged
	and cried, “Of all wives I am the unluckiest! Must I take my
	rival with me everywhere? Because of her I first had a lover
	stolen away in Phoenicia, and now I risk losing my husband.
	But Anthia will be sorry for looking good to Moeris
	too, because I’m going to punish her for it, and also for
	what happened in Tyre!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. For the moment then she kept
	quiet, but when Moeris was out of town she summoned the
	goatherd and told him to seize Anthia, take her into the
	thickest woods, and kill her, and for this she promised to
	pay him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He felt sorry for the girl, but for fear of Manto he went to Anthia and told her what had been decided in her case. She shrieked and began to wail, saying “Oh, how this beauty of ours conspires everywhere against us both! Because of our troublesome good looks Habrocomes is
	done for in Tyre, and I here.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. But I ask you, goatherd
	Lampo, since you have thus far behaved respectfully, if you
	kill me, give me at least a shallow grave in the ground
	nearby, put your hands on my eyes, and invoke Habrocomes
	repeatedly as you bury me: for me this would make
	a happy funeral, in the presence of Habrocomes.”

	feel pity at your beauty, so I would rather sell you somewhere

	9. The goatherd
	took hold of Anthia and set off toward the shore, where he
	found some Cilician[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] merchants and sold the girl, and taking
	what he was paid for her he returned to the farm.

	The bandit Hippothous’ gang spent that night partying, [c dimgray]13[/c]

	a distance, and tried to hit it with javelins, and the god was
	considered to accept the sacrifice of all who scored a hit,
	while those who missed tried to appease him a second
	time. It was Anthia who was to serve as this kind of sacrificial
	victim.

	hang her up, they heard rustling in the woods and a din of

	εἰς τὴν εἱρκτὴν παρέδωκε, τὴν δὲ Ἀνθίαν ἐθεράπευεν.
	ἦν δὲ οὔτε γυνὴ τῷ Περιλάῳ οὔτε παῖδες καὶ περιβολὴ

	name was Perilaus,[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] one of the most powerful men in
	Cilicia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. This Perilaus attacked the bandits with a large
	force and killed them all, except for a few that he captured
	alive. Only Hippothous managed to collect his weapons
	and make a clean getaway.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Perilaus took Anthia and pitied
	her when he heard about the misfortune that had been
	in store for her, but this pity for Anthia spelled the beginning
	of further great misfortune. He took her along with
	the captured bandits to Tarsus in Cilicia.[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. The frequent
	sight of the girl led Perilaus to passion, and by degrees he
	fell captive to Anthia. When they arrived in Tarsus, he had
	the bandits imprisoned and began to devote himself to
	Anthia. Perilaus had no wife or children, and no small amplitude
	of possessions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. He declared to Anthia that she
	would be everything to Perilaus, his wife, his mistress, and
	his children.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. At first she resisted, but she felt helpless to
	act as he pressured her and kept insisting, afraid that he
	might resort to something more violent, so she agreed to
	the marriage but begged him to wait a little while, as much
	as thirty days, and to leave her chastity intact. She offered
	some sort of excuse, and Perilaus acquiesced, promising
	that he would keep her pure of marital contact during the
	specified interval.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So she found herself in Tarsus with Perilaus, awaiting [c dimgray]14[/c]
	the deadline for her marriage, while Habrocomes was en
	route to Cilicia. And not far from the bandits’ cave, for
	he himself had wandered off the high road, he encountered
	Hippothous, fully armed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. At the sight of him Hippothous
	ran over, offered a friendly greeting, and asked to

	was proficient in the Cappadocians’ language and
	they all dealt with him as one of their own.

	when I saw his tenacious wrestling in the gymnasium, and I
	lost control of myself.

	youth’s good looks, which could attract anyone at all.

	7. Once in love he could no longer restrain his love, but
	started by sending messages to the youth, and when that
	was getting nowhere, since on account of his feelings for
	me Hyperanthes let no one approach, he won over the
	youth’s father, a bad man with a weakness for money.

	9. I followed, disregarding all my
	own affairs, and spent as much time with the youth as I
	could, but that was seldom; kissing was infrequent and
	conversation difficult, since I was under heavy surveillance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. Finally unable to control myself any longer, I
	steeled myself, returned to Perinthus, sold all the possessions
	I had, got money together and went to Byzantium. I
	took a sword (Hyperanthes had also thought this best), entered
	Aristomachus’ house at night, found him in bed with
	the boy, and filled with rage, I struck Aristomachus a fatal
	blow.

	11. It was quiet and everyone was alseep. I left unnoticed
	and without difficulty, taking Hyperanthes with me. I
	travelled all night to Perinthus, immediately boarded a
	ship without being seen by anyone, and set sail for Asia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. For a while the voyage went favorably, but in the end a
	heavy wind struck us off Lesbos and sank our ship. I did
	manage to swim alongside Hyperanthes and make his
	swimming easier by supporting him, but when night fell
	the youth could no longer hold on, his swimming slackened,
	and he died.

	13. I had only enough strength to salvage
	his body, bring it ashore, and bury it. With much
	weeping and lamentation I took away relics, and able to
	come up with only a single stone that somehow lay at hand,
	I placed it on his grave and inscribed it with this epitaph,
	composed on the spot, as a memorial to the unfortunate
	youth:

	took up banditry. At first I was an underling in a gang but in

	long before I spotted you. 15. This is the bad luck in my

	4. Shortly before my gang was captured, a beautiful girl came
	upon our cave in her wanderings; she was the same age as
	you and said that she was from your country. I found out
	nothing else. We decided to sacrifice her to Ares, and in
	fact everything was ready when the posse came upon us.
	I got away, but I don’t know what became of her.

	5. She
	was very beautiful, Habrocomes, and wearing inexpensive
	clothing; blonde hair, sexy eyes.” While he was still speaking,
	Habrocomes cried out, “It was my Anthia you saw,
	Hippothous! But where has she fled? What land holds her?
	Let’s go back to Cilicia, let’s look for her! She cannot be far
	from the hideout.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. By the soul of your own Hyperanthes,
	please don’t deliberately wrong me, but let’s go where we
	can find Anthia!” Hippothous promised to do all he could,
	and in fact said that they should recruit a few men for
	safety on the trip.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. That was their situation as they made
	plans to return to Cilicia. Meanwhile, Anthia’s thirty days
	had passed and preparations for Perilaus’ wedding were
	underway: sacrificial victims were being brought in from
	the countryside and there was a great abundance of everything
	else. His friends and family were gathered, and many
	of the citizens were celebrating Anthia’s marriage as well.

	While Anthia, snatched from the hideout, <was sojourning [c dimgray]4[/c]

	that she would be glad to see someone from Ephesus.
	She kindly received Eudoxus and tried to find out if he had

	that he knew nothing, having been away from Ephesus for

	5. She had just finished speaking when Eudoxus, the
	Ephesian physician, arrived at her door. She took him away
	to a quiet room, fell at his knees, and begged him to say
	nothing to anyone of what she was about to tell him, making
	him swear by their ancestral goddess Artemis to assist
	her in everything she might ask of him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Eudoxus made her
	get up as she bewailed her many sorrows, urged her to take
	heart, and promised on oath to do it all. Then she told him
	about her love of Habrocomes, her oaths to him, and her
	vows of chastity.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. “If I could live to recover Habrocomes
	alive,” she said, “or get away from here unnoticed, that would
	be my plan. But since he is dead, flight is impossible, and to
	endure my impending marriage is out of the question, for I
	will never transgress my pact with Habrocomes or disregard
	my oath, please come to my aid by finding some drug
	that will free me, so unhappy, from my torments.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. For this
	you will have substantial rewards from the gods: before my
	death I will pray to them repeatedly on your behalf. And I
	myself will give you money and arrange for your transport
	home. You will be able to board a ship before anyone finds
	out and sail to Ephesus. When you get there, seek out my
	parents Megamedes and Euhippe and tell them how my
	life ended, everything that happened when I was away, and
	that Habrocomes is no more.”
	[m1]\ [/m]

	He pondered the matter carefully, felt sorry for the girl’s
	plight, wanted the trip back to Ephesus, was vanquished
	by the money and gifts, promised to give her the poison,
	and went off to get it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. In the interval she lamented copiously,
	bewailing her own youth and grieving that she was
	about to die before her time, and she called out to Habrocomes
	as if he were there.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. Meanwhile Eudoxus was not
	gone for long and arrived with a drug that would cause not
	death but sleep, so that no harm would come to the girl and
	he would get his travel money and return safely. Anthia accepted
	the drug with deep gratitude and sent him on his
	way. He boarded a ship at once and sailed away, while she
	looked for a suitable opportunity to drink the poison.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now it was night; the bridal chamber was made ready [c dimgray]6[/c]
	and those assigned to the task had arrived to collect Anthia.
	She set forth unwillingly and in tears, hiding the poison in
	her hand. As she drew near the chamber, the family sang
	the bridal hymn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But she grieved and wept: “This is the
	way,” she said, “that I was once taken to my bridegroom
	Habrocomes. A fire of love escorted us and a bridal hymn
	celebrated a happy marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. But what will you do this
	time, Anthia? Will you wrong your husband Habrocomes,
	the one you love, the one who died for you? I am no such
	coward or so worthless in adversity. My decision stands: let
	us drink the poison. Habrocomes must be my <only> husband,
	and I want him even if he is dead.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. With these
	words she was led into the bridal chamber. Now she was by
	herself, while Perilaus was still at the feast with his friends.
	Pretending that her anxiety had made her thirsty, she told

	one.” With these words she drank, at once fell into a deep
	sleep, and sank to the floor as the drug exerted its force.

	As Perilaus came in and at once saw Anthia prostrate, [c dimgray]7[/c]
	he was stunned and cried out, and throughout the household
	there was considerable hubbub and confused emotions:
	grief, fear, astonishment. Some felt sorry for the girl
	who seemed to be dead, others shared Perilaus’ grief, all
	lamented what had happened.

	2. Perilaus tore his clothing
	and fell upon the body. “My dearest girl,” he cried, “you
	have abandoned your lover before your marriage, after being
	Perilaus’ intended bride for only a few days. To a fine
	bridal chamber will I be carrying you—the tomb!

	Habrocomes, whoever he was, a man truly fortunate to receive
	such gifts from a beloved girl.” Such were his lamentations

	sacrificing many victims and burning much clothing

	been given a lavish burial and that a lot of female finery as

	nightfall they went to the tomb, broke open the door, entered
	the tomb, carried off the finery, and saw that Anthia
	was alive. Thinking this too a great windfall, they raised
	her up and wanted to take her away.

	their feet and repeatedly entreated them. “Gentlemen,

	not convince the pirates: they led her from the tomb, took

	θάλαμον εἰσελθοῦσα, εἴτε μανεῖσα εἴτε ἄλλου τινὸς
	ἐρῶσα, πιοῦσα φάρμακόν ποθεν ἀποθνῄσκει· οὗτος
	γὰρ ὁ τοῦ θανάτου τρόπος αὐτῆς ἐλέγετο.” ἀκούσας ὁ
	Ἱππόθοος “αὕτη” ἔφησεν “ἐστὶν ἡ κόρη, ἣν Ἁβροκόμης
	ζητεῖ.”
	[m1]\ [/m]

	“ἀλλὰ νῦν μὲν σαφῶς τέθνηκεν Ἀνθία καὶ τάφος ἴσως
	αὐτῆς ἐστιν ἐνθάδε καὶ τὸ σῶμα σῴζεται.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. λέγων
	ἐδεῖτο τῆς πρεσβύτιδος τῆς Χρυσίου ἄγειν ἐπὶ τὸν
	τάφον αὐτῆς καὶ δεῖξαι τὸ σῶμα· ἡ δὲ ἀναστενάξασα
	“τοῦτο γὰρ” ἔφη “τῇ κόρῃ <τῇ>[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] ταλαιπώρῳ τὸ δυστυχέστατον·
	ὁ μὲν γὰρ Περίλαος καὶ ἔθαψεν αὐτὴν
	πολυτελῶς καὶ ἐκόσμησε, πυθόμενοι δὲ τὰ συνταφέντα
	λῃσταὶ ἀνορύξαντες τὸν τάφον τόν τε κόσμον
	ἀνείλοντο καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἀφανὲς ἐποίησαν, ἐφ᾿ οἷς
	πολλὴ καὶ μεγάλη ζήτησις ὑπὸ Περιλάου γίνεται.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]10[/c]Ἀκούσας ὁ Ἁβροκόμης περιέρρηξε τὸν χιτῶνα καὶ
	μεγάλως ἀνωδύρετο καλῶς μὲν καὶ σωφρόνως ἀποθανοῦσαν
	Ἀνθίαν, δυστυχῶς δὲ μετὰ τὸν θάνατον
	ἀπολομένην.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “τίς ἄρα λῃστὴς οὕτως ἐρωτικὸς ἵνα
	καὶ νεκρᾶς ἐπιθυμήσῃ σου, ἵνα καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἀφέληται;
	ἀπεστερήθην σοῦ ὁ δυστυχὴς καὶ τῆς μόνης ἐμοὶ

	3. ἀποθανεῖν μὲν οὖν ἔγνωσται πάντως,
	ἀλλὰ τὰ πρῶτα καρτερήσω μέχρι που τὸ σῶμα εὕρω
	τὸ σὸν καὶ περιβαλὼν ἐμαυτὸν ἐκείνῳ συγκαταθάψω.”
	ταῦτα ἔλεγεν ὀδυρόμενος, θαρρεῖν δὲ αὐτὸν παρεκάλουν

	entered the bridal chamber and, whether she was insane
	or in love with someone else, she drank poison from somewhere
	and died: people said this was the manner of her
	death.” When Hippothous heard this he said, “That is the
	girl Habrocomes is looking for.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Habrocomes listened to
	the story but in despondency ignored it, until at length and
	with difficulty he leapt up when Hippothous spoke: “Now
	Anthia is clearly dead, but perhaps her tomb is here and
	her body is preserved.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. With these words he asked the
	old lady Chrysium to lead him to her tomb and show him
	the body, but she cried out and said, “This is what was most
	unfortunate for the poor girl: Perilaus buried and adorned
	her lavishly, but pirates found out what was buried with
	her, dug up the tomb, snatched the finery, and made off
	with the body. Accordingly a search by Perilaus is underway
	far and wide.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Habrocomes heard this he tore up his tunic and [c dimgray]10[/c]
	loudly mourned Anthia, dead in fine and chaste fashion
	but unfortunately lost after death:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “What pirate is so enamored
	as to desire you even dead, as to take even your
	body away? It is my misfortune to be deprived of the one
	part of you that would have been a consolation to me.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. So
	I am wholly resolved to die, but first I will persevere until I
	find and embrace your body, then bury myself with it.”
	With these words he mourned, while Hippothous’ gang
	tried to console him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. At that point they turned in for
	the rest of the night, but Habrocomes kept thinking about
	everything: Anthia, her death, her tomb, her disappearance.
	Finally unable to bear it any longer, while Hippothous’
	gang lay prostrate from drinking he pretended to

	need something, slipped away, and leaving everyone behind
	went to the shore, happened on a ship departing
	for Alexandria, went aboard, and sailed off hoping to catch
	in Egypt the pirates who had plundered everything. An
	unfortunate hope it was that led him on this path.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. In
	the morning, while Habrocomes was sailing to Alexandria,
	Hippothous’ gang were annoyed at his departure, but after
	a few days they recovered and decided to travel to Syria
	and Phoenicia for banditry.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Meanwhile the pirates put in at Alexandria and made a [c dimgray]11[/c]
	lot of money by selling Anthia to merchants, who kept her
	at great expense and took care of her appearance, since
	they were on the lookout for a buyer at the right price.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. And indeed someone did come to Alexandria from India
	to see the city and do some shopping, one of the kings
	there by the name of Psammis.[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This Psammis saw
	Anthia in the merchants’ district and at the sight of her was
	captivated, paid the merchants a lot of money, and took her
	as a maidservant.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. As soon as he bought her, the barbaric
	fellow tried to force himself upon her and use her for sex.
	She was unwilling and at first refused, but in the end made
	Psammis the excuse—barbarians are naturally superstitious—
	that her father had dedicated her at birth to Isis until
	she was of marriageable age, and she told him that there
	was still a year before that time came.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. “So if you violate
	the goddess’ protégé,” she said, “she will be angry and your
	punishment harsh.” Psammis believed her, made obeisance
	to the goddess, and left Anthia alone.

	2. Local shepherds[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c] attacked
	them when they were cast ashore, plundered their cargo,
	bound the men and took them on a long desert road
	to the Egyptian city of Pelusium,[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] and sold them there
	to various buyers. An old retired soldier by the name of
	Araxus[c dimgray][sup]43[/sup][/c] bought Habrocomes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This Araxus had a wife
	foul to behold, much worse to listen to, insatiable beyond
	all bounds, named Cyno.[c dimgray][sup]44[/sup][/c] This Cyno developed a lust for
	Habrocomes as soon as he was brought into the house and
	soon could no longer restrain herself, being dreadfully
	lustful and eager to indulge her passion.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. While Araxus
	liked Habrocomes and treated him like a son, Cyno propositioned
	him for sex, pressed him to give in, and promised
	to take him as a husband \[and kill Araxus\].[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c] Habrocomes
	thought this dreadful and considered many factors together:
	Anthia, his oaths, the chastity that had already
	done him so much harm. In the end, under pressure from
	Cyno, he agreed to her proposition.

	most of them obscure, they came to Coptus,[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] near Ethiopia.

	was a large crowd of merchants passing through on their

	gang of five hundred men. When they had taken the

	Meanwhile Habrocomes appeared before the prefect [c dimgray]2[/c]
	of Egypt, and the Pelusians had written him a report of
	what had happened, both the murder of Araxus and that it
	was a slave who had dared such deeds. Hearing the particulars

	he ordered Habrocomes to be taken away and crucified.[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c]

	the sun and looked at the Nile stream, and said, “Kindliest
	of gods, who hold sway over Egypt, through whom both
	earth and sky are revealed to all mankind, if Habrocomes
	has done any wrong, let me perish miserably and receive a
	worse punishment than this, if any there be,

	been betrayed by an evil woman, may the Nile stream
	never be polluted by the body of one unjustly destroyed,
	and may you never see such a sight, a person who has done
	no wrong being destroyed on this your very own land.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. This was his prayer and the god took pity on him: a sudden
	gust of wind arose, struck the cross, and blew away the soil
	on the cliff where the cross had been planted. Habrocomes
	pitched into the stream and was borne away; neither did
	the water harm him nor his fetters impede him nor the
	river beasts injure him, but the stream was his escort.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. He
	was carried to the mouth of the Nile where it flows into the
	sea, and there the garrison arrested him and took him before
	the governor of Egypt as a fugitive from justice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. He
	was even angrier than before, and taking him for an utter
	criminal ordered them to build a pyre, put Habrocomes on
	it, and burn him up. Everything was made ready, the pyre
	by the mouth of the Nile, and Habrocomes was put on it
	while the fire was laid below, but just as the flame was
	about to reach his body he said more prayers, what little he
	could manage, to save him from his present misfortunes.

	they set out on their journey. They had passed through
	Coptus and were crossing the boundaries of Ethiopia
	when Hippothous attacked them. He killed Psammis and

	4. This increased Anchialus’
	torment, and the daily sight of Anthia stoked his
	lust. When he could no longer bear it he tried to force
	Anthia,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. and one night, when Hippothous was away with
	the others on a raid, he got up and attempted to rape her.
	In her helpless predicament she drew a sword lying nearby
	and stabbed Anchialus, and the stroke was fatal: trying
	to embrace and kiss her, he had got completely on top of
	her, and she brought up the sword from underneath and
	stabbed him in the chest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. And so Anchialus paid a fitting
	penalty for his evil passion, but Anthia grew fearful
	about her deed and did much pondering whether to kill
	herself, though she still had some hope for Habrocomes,
	or whether to flee the cave, though that was impractical:
	the road was not open to her, nor was there anyone to show
	her the way. So she decided to wait in the cave and face
	whatever her fate decreed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	All that night she waited, able to get no sleep and deep [c dimgray]6[/c]
	in thought. At daybreak Hippothous’ gang arrived, saw
	Anchialus done in and Anthia beside his body, guessed
	what had happened, and got the whole story from her under
	questioning.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. In their anger at what had happened
	they decided to avenge their dead friend and discussed
	various scenarios for Anthia: someone recommended that
	they kill her and bury her with Anchialus’ body, another
	that they crucify her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. But Hippothous was distressed
	about Anchialus and determined a worse punishment for
	Anthia. He told them to dig a pit wide and deep and throw

	a heavy penalty for her audacious behavior.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. They did as
	they were told, and Anthia was taken to the pit and the
	dogs along with her; they were Egyptian and altogether
	huge and frightful to behold. After they threw them in,
	they put big planks over the pit and piled dirt on top, for
	the Nile was not far distant, and stationed Amphinomus,[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]
	one of the bandits, as guard.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. This Amphinomus was already
	captivated by Anthia, so he now felt all the more
	sorry for her and pitied her situation. He figured out how
	to keep her alive and the dogs from molesting her: at regular
	intervals he removed the planks covering the pit, tossed
	in some bread, supplied some water, and this way encouraged
	Anthia to persevere,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. and since the dogs were being
	fed, they did nothing terrible to her but now became tame
	and gentle. But as Anthia took stock of herself and considered
	her present situation, she cried “What misfortunes
	are mine! What vengeance I endure! A pit for a prison,
	shut in with dogs much gentler than the bandits! Habrocomes,
	my sufferings are the same as yours,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. for you were
	once in the same plight, where I left you behind imprisoned
	in Tyre. If you still live, it is not terrible at all, for perhaps
	we will hold one another someday, but if you are already
	dead, my own fight for life is pointless, and pointless
	is this man’s pity for my situation, whoever he is.” In this
	fashion did she cry out and mourn, shut in the pit with the
	dogs, while Amphinomus at regular intervals consoled her
	and gentled the dogs with his feedings.

	Habrocomes completed his voyage from Egypt but did [c dimgray]1[/c]
	not reach Italy itself because the wind drove at his ship,
	blew it off course, and took it to Sicily, where they disembarked
	at the large and beautiful city of Syracuse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Once
	there, Habrocomes decided to explore the island and continue
	his search for any news about Anthia. So he settled
	himself near the coast with an old man, Aegialeus,[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] a
	fisherman by trade. 2. This Aegialeus was a poor foreigner
	who only just supported himself by his trade, but he was
	happy to take Habrocomes in, treated him like his own son,
	and showed him special affection.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When they reached
	the point of great familiarity with each other, Habrocomes
	told him his story: he spoke about Anthia, his love for her,
	and his wanderings, and then Aegialeus started in on his
	own story.

	6. For a while we were together

	together even unto death. But apparently some god was
	envious. I was still in the ephebes, and her parents betrothed
	Thelxinoe to a young Spartan named Androcles,[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c]
	who was also now in love with her.

	7. At first the girl made
	many excuses to postpone the wedding, until finally she

	And so we left town for Argos and Corinth, and from there
	took a ship to Sicily. When the Spartans discovered our

	we enjoyed every advantage, since we had each other.

	12. While Aegialeus was still speaking Habrocomes
	broke down. “And what about you,” he cried, “most
	unfortunate girl of all? When will I find you again, even as a
	corpse? Thelxinoe’s body is a great solace in the life of
	Aegialeus, and now I truly know that true love has no age

	am unable even to get word of you. What unlucky prophecies!
	Apollo, who gave us the harshest of all oracles, take
	pity on us at last and bring your prophecies to their conclusion!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so Habrocomes lamented in this fashion, with [c dimgray]2[/c]
	Aegialeus trying to console him, while he lived on in Syracuse
	and now took part in Aegialeus’ trade. Meanwhile
	Hippothous’ gang had now organized a large bandit force
	and planned to set out from Ethiopia and undertake bigger
	operations,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. for Hippothous thought it unsatisfactory to
	be robbing individuals unless he also attacked villages and
	cities. So he rounded up his followers and packed everything
	for the trip; he had many pack animals and not a
	few camels. So he left Ethiopia behind and headed for
	Egypt and Alexandria, with thoughts of again <ravaging>
	Phoenicia and Syria. Anthia he presumed dead.

	his tender affection for her and her dangerous situation, so
	he did not follow Hippothous but lost himself among the
	rest of the large gang and hid out in a cave with the provisions
	he had amassed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. After nightfall Hippothous’ gang
	arrived in an Egyptian village called Areia,[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c] which they
	wanted to plunder, while Amphinomus was excavating the
	pit, removing Anthia, and urging her to take heart.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. But
	since she was still fearful and mistrustful, he swore by the
	sun and the gods of Egypt that he would surely keep her
	pure of intimacies until she herself was ready to consent
	willingly. Anthia trusted Amphinomus’ oaths and followed
	him, nor were the dogs left behind but were happy to become
	their companions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. And so they went to Coptus and
	decided to spend a few days there until Hippothous’ gang
	had gone farther ahead on the road, and they took care that
	the dogs had what they needed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Meanwhile Hippothous’
	gang struck the village of Areia and killed many of the inhabitants,
	burned their houses, and moved out not by the
	same route but on the Nile, for they collected all the boats
	from the intervening villages, got aboard them, and sailed
	for Schedia and <Hermupolis>, and disembarking there
	they continued their journey through the rest of Egypt by
	the banks of the Nile.

	so he readied a large number of soldiers, appointed as
	their leader one of his own kinsmen, Polyidus,[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c] a young
	man fair to behold and lusty in action, and dispatched
	them against the bandits.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. This Polyidus took his army
	and met Hippothous’ forces at Pelusium, where at once
	battle was joined along the riverbanks and there were
	many casualties on both sides. At nightfall the bandits
	were routed and all were killed by the soldiers, though
	some were taken alive.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Only Hippothous threw away his
	weapons, fled during the night, and went to Alexandria,
	where he was able to stay out of sight, board a ship that was
	just departing, and sail away. His whole effort was focused
	on reaching Sicily: there he expected most easily to escape
	detection and make his living, for he had heard that the
	island was large and prosperous.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Polyidus did not consider it enough to defeat the bandits [c dimgray]4[/c]
	in an engagement but decided that he should also
	launch a thorough investigation and purge of Egypt, in
	hope of locating either Hippothous or any of his followers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So he took a detachment of his army and the captured
	bandits, so that they would let him know in case any turned
	up, and set sail up the Nile, searched through the cities,
	and planned to go as far as Ethiopia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. And so they arrived
	in Coptus where Anthia was staying with Amphinomus.
	She happened to be in the house, but the captured bandits
	recognized Amphinomus and told Polyidus. Amphinomus
	was captured and under interrogation told them about
	Anthia. At this news he gave orders for Anthia to be produced,
	and when she arrived he questioned her closely
	about who she was and where from. In reply she spoke not

	the bandits.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. At this point Polyidus too began to feel a
	strong lust for Anthia, though he had a wife in Alexandria.
	In his lust he first tried to seduce her with great promises,
	but in the end they continued the journey down to Alexandria,
	and when they reached Memphis Polyidus tried to
	force Anthia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. She managed to escape, went to the temple
	of Isis, and became a suppliant. “Mistress of Egypt,”
	she said, “who time and again have assisted me, please
	be my savior once more. Let Polyidus too spare me, as
	with your help I keep myself chaste for Habrocomes.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Polyidus at once respected the goddess, lusted for Anthia,
	and pitied her misfortune. He went to the temple alone
	and swore never to force Anthia or do her any violence but
	rather to keep her pure as long as she herself wished, for in
	his affection he considered it enough simply to look at her
	and talk with her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. Anthia, convinced by these avowals,
	came out of the temple, and when they decided to rest in
	Memphis for three days, Anthia went to the temple of
	Apis.[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c] This temple was the most eminent in Egypt, and
	the god gave prophecies to those wanting them:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. anyone
	who comes, prays, and makes an enquiry to the god, he
	emerges and the Egyptian boys in front of the temple foretell
	what the future holds in each case, sometimes in prose
	and sometimes in verse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. And so Anthia came and fell
	before Apis. “Most humane of gods,” she said, “who show
	mercy to all strangers, take pity on me as well, an unlucky
	woman, and pronounce me a true prophecy about Habrocomes.

	Anthia soon will recover Habrocomes, her very own

	Polyidus’ wife found out that he was bringing home a [c dimgray]5[/c]
	girlfriend and feared that this foreign girl might somehow
	surpass her in favor. So she said nothing to Polyidus but devised
	her own plot to take revenge on the girl who seemed
	to have designs on her marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Polyidus was busy making
	his expeditionary report to the prefect of Egypt and in
	his camp carrying out other duties as commander, and in
	his absence Rhenaea,[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c] for this was what Polyidus’ wife was
	called, sent for Anthia, who was in the house, tore off her
	clothes, and abused her body.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. “Wicked girl,” she said,
	“with designs on my marriage, you attracted Polyidus in
	vain, because this beauty of yours will get you nothing.
	Maybe you could seduce bandits and sleep with a lot of
	drunken boys, but you will never get away with violating
	Rhenaea’s bed!”

	her to Italy, and sell her to a pimp. “That way, my beauty”
	she said, “you will be able to satisfy your insatiable lust.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Anthia was led away by Clytus in tearful lamentation.
	“Treacherous beauty!” she cried, “Good looks that bring
	only bad luck! Why do you stay and bother me? Why are
	you the cause of so much trouble for me? Were the burials,
	the murders, the chains, the banditry not enough? Must I
	now be on display in front of a whorehouse, and will a pimp
	force me to give up the faithfulness that until now I have
	kept for Habrocomes?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. No, master,” she said, falling at
	Clytus’ knees, “please don’t present me for that kind of
	punishment but kill me yourself! I will not endure a pimp
	for a master: believe me, I have always been virtuous!”
	This was her plea, and Clytus felt pity for her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. While she
	was being borne away to Italy, Rhenaea told Polyidus on
	his return that Anthia had run off, and judging by the previous
	incidents he believed her. Anthia was taken to Tarentum,
	a city in Italy, where Clytus, anxious about Rhenaea’s
	orders, sold her to a pimp.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. When he set eyes on such
	beauty as he had never before beheld, he reckoned the
	girl would make him a big profit, so for a few days he let her
	recover from the exhaustion of the voyage and Rhenaea’s
	torments. Clytus returned to Alexandria and informed
	Rhenaea what had been done.

	in Syracuse, after a long time had passed he was
	afflicted by terrible discouragement and despair, because
	he could neither find Anthia nor regain his homeland.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So he decided to sail from Sicily and go up to Italy and
	from there, should he succeed in none of his quests, to
	make an emptyhanded voyage back to Ephesus. By now
	their parents and all the Ephesians were very sorrowful,
	since from them no messenger had come and no letters,
	but still they dispatched people to search for them everywhere.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Through loss of spirit and old age, each one’s
	parents were unable to hold out and released themselves
	from life. Habrocomes was on his way to Italy, while Leuco
	and Rhoda, the companions of Habrocomes and Anthia,
	decided to sail back to Ephesus after their master had died
	in Xanthus and left them his estate, a large one. They
	thought that their masters were safely home, and they had
	had enough of the complications of life abroad.

	4. They put
	all their belongings on a ship and sailed for Ephesus, completing
	the voyage to Rhodes in only a few days. When they
	learned there that Habrocomes and Anthia had not yet
	come safely home and that their parents were dead, they
	decided not to return to Ephesus but to stay where they
	were for a while, pending some news of their masters.

	spoke she was taken to the whorehouse, the pimp alternately
	asking her to cheer up and making threats. When
	she got there and took her position out front, a crowd of
	men streamed over, marvelling at her beauty and many of
	them ready to lay out money for what they wanted.

	4. But
	in her impossible predicament she found a means of escape:
	she fell to the ground, let her body go limp, and imitated
	the victims of the so-called sacred disease. Those
	present felt pity and fear, let go their desire for sex and
	tried to take care of Anthia.

	5. The pimp, realizing what a
	mess he was in and thinking that the girl was truly sick,
	took her to his house, lay her down, and tried to treat her,
	and when she seemed to be herself again he questioned
	her about the nature of her sickness.

	6. Anthia replied,
	“Master, I have been meaning to tell you about this condition
	of mine and to explain the circumstances, but I concealed
	it out of shame. But as it stands, there is no difficulty
	in telling you, since by now you know everything there is to
	know about me.

	7. When I was still a girl, I wandered away
	from my friends during a nightlong festival and came upon
	the grave of a man recently deceased, and there someone
	appeared to leap up from the grave and started grabbing
	me. I tried to run away and screamed.

	was frightening to behold and had a voice that was much

	at various times and in various ways. But please, master,
	don’t be angry with me, for none of this is my fault. You
	could surely sell me and lose none of the price you paid.”
	The pimp was annoyed to hear this but agreed that her suffering
	was involuntary.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so she was treated at the pimp’s house as if she [c dimgray]8[/c]
	were sick, while Habrocomes had returned from Sicily and
	put in at Nucerium[c dimgray][sup]75[/sup][/c] in Italy. Lacking means and at a loss
	what to do, he first went around searching for Anthia, since
	she was his whole reason for living and wandering, but
	when he found nothing, for the girl was at the pimp’s house
	in Tarentum, he hired himself out to a company working in
	the quarries.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The work was hard on him: he was not in
	the least accustomed to subjecting his body to strenuous or
	punishing tasks but fared poorly and frequently bemoaned
	his own bad luck. “Here, Anthia,” he said, “behold your
	Habrocomes, a laborer in a low job, who have submitted
	my body to servitude.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. And if I had any hope of finding
	you and spending the rest of our lives together, that would
	console me better than anything. But as it is, I may be just a
	wretch doing vain and unprofitable labor, and you may
	have died somewhere of longing for Habrocomes: for I am
	sure, dearest one, that even in death you would never have
	forgotten me.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Thus he lamented and bore his painful
	labors, but Anthia had a dream as she slept in Tarentum.
	She dreamt that she was with Habrocomes, she was

	beautiful and so was he, and it was the time when they first
	fell in love; then some other woman appeared, a beauty,
	and drew Habrocomes away from her; and finally, as he
	shouted and called to her by name, she sat up and the
	dream stopped.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. When she had this dream she leapt
	straight up, let out a wail, and thought what she had seen
	was real. “What troubles!” she said, “I put up with every
	kind of struggle, I am beset in my misfortune by manifold
	predicaments, and I find resources of virtue beyond a
	woman’s means, Habrocomes, but in your eyes some other
	woman perhaps seems beautiful, for that is what my dream
	signifies to me.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. Then why should I keep on living? Why
	should I cause myself pain? Better then to perish and be
	rid of this wretched life, and be rid of this unseemly and
	dangerous servitude.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. But even if Habrocomes has broken
	his vows, may the gods not punish him: perhaps he
	acted under compulsion, but for me the right course is to
	die virtuous.” These were her words as she wailed and
	sought a way to end her life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Meanwhile Hippothous of Perinthus spent the first [c dimgray]9[/c]
	part of his sojourn in Tauromenium in poor condition
	through lack of means, but as time passed an old woman
	fell in love with him, and under compulsion of his poverty
	he married the old woman. He had lived with her a short
	time when she died, and he inherited great wealth and
	prosperity: a large retinue of servants, a large amount of
	clothing, and an extravagant array of belongings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. He decided
	to sail to Italy and buy young servants and maids and
	the rest of the list of belongings that become a prosperous
	gentleman. But he was always thinking of Habrocomes

	and prayed that he would find him, putting great value
	on sharing with him his whole way of life and his possessions.

	3. And so he took ship and reached Italy, accompanied
	by a lad from one of the good families of Sicily
	named Cleisthenes,[c dimgray][sup]76[/sup][/c] who was handsome and so shared
	in all Hippothous’ possessions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Meanwhile the pimp
	thought Anthia was healthy again and made plans to sell
	her. And so he led her to the market and displayed her to
	prospective buyers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. At this juncture Hippothous was going
	about the city of Tarentum looking for something fine
	to buy when he saw Anthia, recognized her, was astounded
	at the coincidence, and had a long conversation with himself.
	“Isn’t this the girl that back in Egypt I buried in a pit
	and shut up with dogs to avenge Anchialus’ murder? What
	then is this turn-about? How was she rescued? What was
	her way out of the pit? What was her salvation against all
	odds?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. With this he stepped up as if wishing to buy her,
	and standing close to her he said, “My girl, don’t you know
	Egypt? Didn’t you fall among bandits in Egypt? And didn’t
	you have another terrible experience in that country? Feel
	free to tell me, because I recognize you from that place.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. When she heard mention of Egypt and was reminded
	about Anchialus, the bandit gang, and the pit, she groaned
	and wailed. She looked closely at Hippothous but did not
	recognize him at all. “I did have many terrible experiences
	in Egypt, stranger,” she said, “whoever you may be, and I
	did fall among bandits. But tell me, please, how do you
	know my story?
	[m1]\ [/m]

	9. Hearing
	this and recognizing her all the more from what she said,
	Hippothous was quiet at first, but after he had bought her
	from the pimp, he took her home, encouraged her, told her
	who he was, reminded her of what had happened in Egypt,
	and told the story of his own flight and wealth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. She
	asked his forgiveness and also explained that she had killed
	Anchialus for behaving intemperately, and told the story
	of the pit, Amphinomus, the taming of the dogs, and
	her salvation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. Hippothous felt sorry for her but had yet
	to learn her identity. In daily contact with the girl Hippothous
	too came to desire her, wanted to go to bed with
	her, and made many promises.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. At first she refused him,
	claiming that she was unworthy of a master’s bed, but in
	the end, as Hippothous kept pressing, she did no know
	how to proceed, and thinking that it was better to tell him
	all her secrets than to break her pact with Habrocomes,
	she told him about Habrocomes, Ephesus, their love, their
	vows, their predicaments, the bandit gangs, all the while
	grieving over Habrocomes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	13. When Hippothous heard
	that she was Anthia and the wife of his dearest friend, he
	hugged her, told her to be of good cheer, and explained
	his own affection for Habrocomes. He kept her in his
	house and showed her every consideration out of respect
	for Habrocomes, while he launched a full investigation in
	hope of finding Habrocomes.

	spending a few days and praying to the Cyprians’ ancestral
	goddess,[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c] he resumed his voyage and arrived in Rhodes,
	where he settled himself near the harbor.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Now that he
	was near Ephesus, all of his terrible experiences came to
	mind, his country, his parents, Anthia and their servants.
	With a deep sigh he said, “What troubles! I will arrive in
	Ephesus alone, my own parents will see me without Anthia,
	I will be a wretch making a useless voyage, and having no
	partner in my experiences I will tell stories that perhaps no
	one will believe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. But persevere, Habrocomes, and when
	you get to Ephesus, live on long enough to raise a tomb for
	Anthia, mourn her, and pour libations; then it will be time
	to put yourself beside her.” With that he went around the
	city distraught with dejection about Anthia’s case and with
	lack of provisions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Meanwhile Leuco and Rhoda, who
	were staying in Rhodes, had set up a dedication in the temple
	of Helius beside the golden panoply that Anthia and

	order to pay homage to Aphrodite.

	Habrocomes had dedicated. They set up a monument inscribed
	with golden lettering in honor of Habrocomes and
	Anthia, and also inscribed their own names, Leuco and Rhoda,
	as the dedicators.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Habrocomes, who had come to offer
	prayers to the god, happened on this monument. When he
	read it and recognized the dedicators and the goodwill of
	his servants, and when he saw the panoply nearby, he sat
	down beside the monument and heaved a loud groan.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. “How unlucky I am in everything!” he said, “I have come to
	the end of my life and to a reminder of my own misfortunes.
	Look, this is the very panoply that I dedicated with
	Anthia; with her I sailed away from Rhodes, and now I
	have come back without her. If this monument is the dedication
	of our companions in honor of both of us, what then
	should I do now that I’m on my own? Where am I to find
	those dearest to me?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. So he lamented, but at this point
	Leuco and Rhoda showed up for their usual prayers to the
	god and beheld Habrocomes sitting by the monument and
	looking at the panoply. They did not recognize him and
	wondered who would be lingering beside someone else’s
	dedications.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. And so Leuco said, “My lad, what do you
	mean by sitting there groaning and lamenting beside dedications
	of no concern to you? What is your interest in this?
	What have you in common with those inscribed here?”
	Habrocomes replied to him by saying, “They are for me, for
	me, these dedications by Leuco and Rhoda, whom after
	Anthia I, Habrocomes the unlucky one, am praying to see.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. On hearing this Leuco’s party were struck speechless
	on the spot, but little by little they recovered and recognized
	him by his appearance, his voice, what he said, and
	his evocation of Anthia. They fell at his feet and told their

	where they were staying, turned their possessions over to
	him, took care of him, treated him, and tried to bolster his
	spirit. But for him nothing had as much value as Anthia,
	and at every turn he mourned for her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So he lived in Rhodes with his companions, considering [c dimgray]11[/c]
	a plan of action, while Hippothous decided to take Anthia
	from Italy to Ephesus, where he could return her to her
	parents and hear something of Habrocomes. And so he put
	all his belongings onto a large Ephesian ship and set out
	with Anthia. After a very pleasant voyage of not many days,
	they put in at Rhodes during the night and lodged near the
	sea with an old woman named Althaea;[c dimgray][sup]78[/sup][/c] he sent Anthia
	upstairs with their hostess and himself rested that night.
	Next day they were on the point of sailing, but a magnificent
	public festival for Helius was being put on by
	all the Rhodians,[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c] with a procession and sacrifice, and a
	throng of citizens celebrating.

	3. Leuco and Rhoda were
	on hand, not so much as participants in the festival as investigators
	after some news of Anthia. And so Hippothous
	came to the temple with Anthia, and when she looked at
	the dedications and remembered times past, “Helius,” she
	said, “who oversee all human affairs and overlook only me

	5. With
	these words and many tears she asked Hippothous to let
	her set aside a lock of her own hair and dedicate it to
	Helius with a few words of prayer about Habrocomes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Hippothous agreed. She cut off as many of her locks as she
	could and found a suitable opportunity, when everyone
	had left the premises, to make her dedication, on which
	she wrote:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	
	On Behalf of Her Husband Habrocomes
	Anthia Dedicated Her Hair To the God
	With this act and a prayer, she left with Hippothous.

	Leuco and Rhoda, who until now had been at the procession, [c dimgray]12[/c]
	stopped at the temple, saw the dedications, and
	recognized their masters’ names. First they kissed the hair

	Anthia, and finally started walking around to see if they
	could find her anywhere; the Rhodian populace already
	knew the names from their previous visit.

	2. Finding nothing
	that day, they departed and told Habrocomes what was
	in the temple. He was impassioned at heart by this unexpected

	3. The

	not yet recognize her, but they took everything in, her

	knees lay speechless. She wondered who they were and
	what they wanted, for she never expected to see Leuco
	and Rhoda.

	5. When they recovered themselves they said,
	“Mistress Anthia, we are your servants, Leuco and Rhoda,

	Habrocomes is safe, and he is here, constantly mourning

	through the middle of the city screaming “Anthia!”
	like a madman. He ran into Anthia’s party at the temple of
	Isis, followed by a large throng of Rhodians.

	3. They recognized
	each other as soon as their eyes met, for this is what
	their hearts desired, and joining in an embrace they fell
	to the ground. Many emotions seized them at once: joy,

	pain, fear, memory of the past, fear about the future. The
	Rhodian people applauded and cheered, loudly invoking
	Isis: “Once again,” they cried, “we see Habrocomes and
	Anthia, the beautiful couple!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. They recovered themselves,
	stood up, and went into the temple of Isis saying,
	“To you, greatest goddess, we are grateful for our salvation.
	Thanks to you, goddess that we esteem most of all, we
	have reclaimed each other.” They prostrated themselves
	before the temple and fell before the altar.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Then they
	made their way to Leuco’s house and went inside, Hippothous
	moved his own belongings to Leuco’s house, and
	they were ready for the voyage to Ephesus. As they sacrificed
	and feasted that day, there were many different stories
	from everyone, what each one had experienced and
	done, and they extended the party until late, since they had
	found each other in the fullness of time.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. When night
	came on, all the others retired where they happened to
	be—Leuco and Rhoda, Hippothous and the lad who had
	attended him on his trip from Sicily to Italy, the handsome
	Cleisthenes—but Anthia retired with Habrocomes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When everyone else had gone to sleep and there was [c dimgray]14[/c]
	absolute quiet, Anthia put her arms around Habrocomes
	and started to cry. “Husband and master,” she said, “I have
	found you again after wandering over many a land and sea,
	after escaping threats from bandits, plots by pirates, insults
	from pimps, chains, pits, fetters, poisons, and burials.

	2. But I have come back to you, Habrocomes master of my
	heart, the same as I was when I first left for Syria from Tyre.

	3. But what about you, Habrocomes? Have you remained
	true, or did some other beauty surpass me? Has no
	one made you forget your vows, and me?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. As she spoke
	she kissed him nonstop. “No, I swear to you,” Habrocomes
	replied, “by this day of ours, so longed for and hard won,
	that I found no girl attractive nor any other woman pleasing
	to my eyes. No, you have recovered Habrocomes just
	as pure as when you left him in prison at Tyre.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this fashion they defended themselves all night long [c dimgray]15[/c]
	and easily convinced each other, because that was what
	they wanted. When day came they boarded a ship, taking
	with them all their belongings, and set sail, and the
	whole populace of Rhodes saw them off. Hippothous too
	went with them, with Cleisthenes and all his belongings.
	In a few days they completed their voyage and put in at
	Ephesus.

	2. The whole city had already heard the news of
	their salvation. As soon as they disembarked they went
	just as they were to the temple of Artemis, offered many
	prayers and made sacrifice, then set up dedications, among
	them dedicating to the goddess the inscription commemorating
	all that they had experienced and done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When
	they had done this, they went up to the city and built great
	tombs for their parents, who from old age and dejection
	had predeceased them, and went on to spend lives together
	that they celebrated like a festival.
