	[b]Introduction[/b]
	[c dimgray]Author and Date[/c]
	We have no external evidence for the Longus to whom [c dimgray]The
	Story of Daphnis and Chloe[/c][c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] is attributed in the MSS.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] The
	name was not uncommon in the imperial period and, like
	many another Roman name, was also borne by Greeks,
	e.g. the Pompeii Longi of Lesbos, the descendants of
	the Greeks given citizenship by Pompey the Great. The
	novel’s Lesbian setting is not traditionally associated with
	pastoral[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and drawn vividly and particularly enough that

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]For the title, which the MSS transmit with three toponymic
	Descriptors—[c dimgray]Poimenika[/c] “Pastoral Tale” in the title (V and F),
	[c dimgray]Aipolika[/c] “Goatherding Tale” (V) and [c dimgray]Lesbiaka[/c] “Lesbian Tale” (F)
	in the subscriptions—see the Introduction to Xenophon of
	Ephesus, n. 1.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]In the title V gives the author’s name as Longos, F (in both title
	and subscription) as Logos. It has been suggested that Logos
	(an attested name but also “book” or “account”) originated in a
	misreading of the title (for example, Florentinus Laurentianus
	627 gives as the title Λόγου ποιμενικῶν περὶ Δάφνιν καὶ
	Χλόην) and that Longos was merely a subsequent attempt to produce
	a more plausible name. But Longos is likelier to have been
	altered to Logos than vice versa, and elsewhere F tends to alter
	proper names.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Though the programmatic figure Lycidas in Theocritus 7 comes from Cydonia, the island off the coast of Lesbos (?), which
	thus may have figured in the tradition, perhaps in Philitas’ poetry.

	Longus could have been a native or resident. On the other
	hand, the island’s erotic, and particularly Sapphic, associations[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	well suited a literary love story; the narrator’s persona
	is that of a non-resident who requires instruction
	from a local expert (Prologue); and his tale is so addressed
	to an audience of non-residents as to suggest discovery
	rather than native familiarity (e.g. 2.1). In any case, the
	novel’s refined style and dense allusiveness suggest that
	Longus was a native speaker of Greek, and its allusions to
	material found in Latin poets but not in their extant Greek
	models were probably to lost Greek models, in particular
	the poems of Philitas of Cos, as signalled by his emblematic
	namesake in the novel.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No internal details fix the novel’s date, but its literary
	and stylistic affinities, taken together, are consistent with
	a date in the middle to late second century ce or early in
	the third: the heyday of the Greek novel (as witnessed
	by the papyri) and a period of cultural efflorescence in
	Greece generally (the “second sophistic”). It has features
	in common with the fictitious letters (especially those of
	farmers and fishermen) by Aelian and Alciphron, with the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Sappho’s poetry is an important intertextual constituent of
	the novel.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Although Philitas (born c. 340 bce) was a major influence on
	Hellenistic and Latin poetry, especially erotic elegy and pastoral,
	little of his work survives (see L. Sbardella, [c dimgray]Filita. Testimonianze e
	frammenti poetici[/c] \[Rome, 2000\]). The passing of the syrinx in
	2.37.3 apparently symbolizes the literary succession Philetas–Theocritus–Longus.

	[c dimgray]Summary[/c]
	Daphnis and Chloe, born to prominent families of
	Mytilene but abandoned as infants in the countryside, are
	suckled respectively by a goat and a ewe, discovered each
	by a different shepherd, and raised by that shepherd’s family.
	Grazing their goats and sheep together in their early
	teens, they develop a strong mutual attraction but know
	nothing about the workings of love, which they gradually
	discover by trial and error. They are pointed in the right direction
	by a wise old shepherd, Philetas, and Daphnis is tutored
	in the basics of lovemaking by a married woman
	from the city. Along the way they encounter external obstacles
	as well—the demands of seasonal labor, separation
	in winter, Daphnis’ abduction by pirates and Chloe’s by a
	party of wealthy young men from Methymna, unwelcome
	attention from amorous rivals—but these they overcome
	with help from the benevolent and ever-present deities
	of the countryside: Pan and the Nymphs, and Dionysus.
	Daphnis’ true identity is discovered when his parents visit
	their country estate, and Chloe’s recognition soon follows.
	The couple are married and finally consummate their love.

	[c darkmagenta][b]LONGUS, The Story of Daphnis and Chloe[/b][/c]
	[b]Daphnis And Chloe[/b]
	Longus’ unique amalgam of romantic prose fiction and
	pastoral poetry well suited his theme: the nature and discovery
	of love. His countryside is based in reality as seen
	through the eyes of his urban narrator and exemplified by
	visiting town-dwellers, including the owners of the land,
	and is not immune to poverty, ignorance, hard labor, and
	base behavior. At the same time it is envisioned as an
	edenic place, under the control of but uncontaminated by
	civilization, where innocence can still be found and where
	nature is not embellished or supplanted by artifice except
	to cater to the expectations of vacationing urban landlords.
	To his pastoral purposes Longus adapted conventional features
	of the romantic novel: the plot is simple and linear instead
	of complex and episodic; a unitary location in Greece
	replaces far-flung and exotic travel; gradual, dynamic, and
	mutual discovery of love replaces static love at first sight
	followed by long separation and belated reunion;[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] and the
	couple’s adventures on the way to happiness are more internal
	and psychological than external, unfolding in time
	rather than confronted in space. Longus adapts his pastoral
	inheritance as well, although its norms and sensibility
	predominate and always transform the conventional novelistic
	elements: the earlier bucolic conception of love as a
	disease requiring a cure (cf. especially the programmatic
	figure of Daphnis in Theocritus 1) is redefined by a conception
	of true love as a natural and organic process, and
	the simplicity of country life is viewed not from the superior
	and ironic perspective of urbanity (exemplified, for example,
	by Simichidas in Theocritus 7) but in a sentimental
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Though Achilles Tatius does something similar in the first
	quarter of his novel.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Daphnis And Chloe[/b]
	and playful light, as an ideal world of the imagination and
	the spirit, reachable only through art and imagination.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The world of [c dimgray]Daphnis and Chloe[/c] is in fact a self-consciously
	literary construction, and the narrative, though
	simple and straightforward on the surface, is extraordinarily
	complex and subtle. In a programmatic Prologue,
	the narrator describes a painting[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] that he happened upon
	while hunting, i.e. he is a townsman who visits the countryside
	for recreation. The painting’s beauty, lovelier even
	than the Nymphs’ grove which it adorned, impelled him to
	respond in writing and to seek out an interpreter of its
	meaning, signalling that the story is not an imitation of life
	but an artifact, that its narrator is himself part of the fiction
	and his authority only partial, and that there is meaning,
	both literary and personal, that lies beyond what he tells us
	and that readers are invited to discover by their own contemplation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The surface behind which contemplative readers can
	glimpse, or project, elusive depths is intricately crafted
	and highly polished: a smooth and tuneful narrative style
	(hiatus is generally avoided), basically Attic, with rhetorical
	heightening in the speeches, deft use of metaphor, and
	the sort of rhythmical, symmetrical, and variegated patterning
	familiar in the Gorgianic and Asianic traditions
	of the second sophistic era, though they are more poetic,
	and worn much more lightly, than in Achilles Tatius and
	Heliodorus. The overall structure is carefully shaped, its
	rhythm and symmetry more musical than geometric, following
	the human and natural pattern of the seasons, the
	protagonists’ parallel process of discovery, the repetition,

	variation, and counterpointing of themes, speeches, and
	events, and the central role played by nature, whose vitality,
	immanent divinity, and musicality complement the human
	action at every turn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Longus also incorporates a wider range of literary texts
	than the other novelists, as befits his fundamentally Hellenistic
	orientation: prominent besides pastoral and romance
	are Homer (especially the [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c]), Sappho,
	Euripides, Plato (especially [c dimgray]Phaedrus[/c]), and (especially in
	Book IV) New Comedy. His literary reminiscences are not
	merely quotation or allusion but always creatively appropriated,
	so that they become part of the fabric of his own
	artistic sensibility and the meaning that his narrator attaches
	to the story. Although his literary interests and moral
	outlook are always foremost, the settings, action, and characters
	are never implausible, as they often are in the other
	novels (especially Xenophon’s). From Theocritus, for example,
	he takes pastoral incidentals, but his portrayal of
	pastoral innocence and erotic awakening in a sympathetic
	natural setting is original, as is his adaptation of motifs and
	descriptive details to suit, or playfully subvert, the narrative
	requirements of a romantic novel.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Longus uses none of his literary or mythological
	sources to construct a consistent framework for his story,
	but near the end of each of the first three books, and corresponding
	to the stages of the couple’s progress in love, is
	an aetiological erotic myth involving Pan, told secondhand,
	about a musical girl, aggression against her, the girl’s
	metamorphosis, and the survival of her music: the wooddove,
	alluding to the myth of Pitys (1.27), Pan and Syrin
	X(2.34, then mimed by the protagonists in 37–39), and Echo
	(3.23). As often, the myths serve to universalize the couple’s
	experience and complicate our responses to it. Their
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 8[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Daphnis And Chloe[/b]
	tragic and violent tenor is at variance with the novel’s overall
	comic-pastoral mode, in which real harm rarely comes
	to anyone and the tutelary divinities are benign, but mythical
	glimpses of this dimension add perspective and contrast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Because of their mythic and initiatory features, the
	Greek and Roman novels have been read as cultic texts derived
	from, or even as esoteric allegories of, the rituals and
	lore of mystery religions, in the case of [c dimgray]Daphnis and Chloe[/c]
	the Dionysiac mysteries or Dionysiac/Orphic theology, in
	which Eros is an avatar of Dionysus. It is true that an atmosphere
	of divine immanence pervades the novel, that education
	is a central theme, that some themes or images are
	found also in Dionysiac cult and myth, and that the narrative
	invites discovery of more than meets the eye. But this
	theory lacks explanatory power: there is nothing in the
	novel that cannot be more naturally accounted for as an element
	of the literary narrative, which is always rationally
	and plausibly motivated; none of its narrative or didactic
	voices has superior authority; and the assumption that the
	novel contains a systematic esoteric meaning is at variance
	with its pervasive humor, irony, playfulness, and ambiguity,
	and is incompatible with the universal appeal claimed
	in the Prologue.

	[c dimgray]Reception[/c]
	Although [c dimgray]Daphnis[/c] has yet to turn up on papyri
	and the earliest likely reminiscence is in a ninth-century
	poem by Constantine of Sicily,[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] the novel has enjoyed a

	Two independent manuscripts preserve the whole (F) or

	(O). F and V derive from the same archetype, V through
	an intermediary manuscript; O is related to V, possibly
	through the lost intermediary (since O predates V). The
	other manuscripts predating the first printed edition of
	the Greek text (Juntine, ed. Raffaello Colombani, Florence,
	1598) all derive from V with occasional contamination
	from F, but they occasionally provide useful corrections
	and conjectures; both the Juntine edition and
	the vernacular versions made before its publication (see
	above) were based on one or another of these derivative
	manuscripts. The standard chapter divisions derive from
	Villoison’s edition (Paris, 1778) as numbered in Passow’s
	edition (Leipzig, 1811).

	On Lesbos while hunting I saw in a Nymphs’ grove a display,
	the fairest I ever saw: an image depicted, a story of
	love. Fair also was the grove, thick with trees, flowery, well
	watered: a single spring nourished it all, flowers and trees
	alike. But that depiction was lovelier still, owning outstanding
	technique and an amorous subject, so that its
	prestige drew many visitors, even strangers, to worship the
	Nymphs and to view the image.

	Mitylene is a city on Lesbos, large and beautiful, for it is [c dimgray]1[/c]
	divided by channels where the sea flows in and adorned by
	bridges of bright polished stone. You will have the impression
	not of a city but an island.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. About two hundred
	stades[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] from this city of Mitylene was a rich man’s country
	manor, a very fine property: hills supporting game, plains
	bearing wheat, slopes spread with vineyards, pastures with
	flocks; and the sea washed upon the soft sand of an extensive
	beach.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While pasturing his flock on this estate a goatherd [c dimgray]2[/c]
	named Lamo[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] found a baby being suckled by a she-goat. It
	was a copse with a bramble thicket, wandering ivy, and soft
	grass where the baby lay. The goat kept running out of
	sight in this direction and abandoning her kid to stay with
	the newborn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Lamo, feeling sorry for the neglected kid,
	kept an eye on these comings and goings, and at high noon
	he tracked her and saw the goat standing over the child
	carefully, so as not to hurt it by treading with her hooves,
	while it sucked her flowing milk as if from a mother’s
	breast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Naturally he was amazed, and coming closer he
	discovered amale child, large and handsome, in swaddling

	His first plan was to ignore the newborn and just make [c dimgray]3[/c]
	off with its tokens of identity. Then feeling ashamed were
	he not to match even a goat’s humanity, he waited until
	nightfall and brought everything to his wife, Myrtale:[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] the
	tokens, the child, and the goat as well.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. She was astounded
	at the thought of goats having babies, so he told
	her the whole story: how he saw it being suckled, how he
	felt ashamed to leave it to die. With her agreement they
	hid the accompanying objects, called the child their own,
	and assigned its feeding to the goat. To assure that even the

	was a cave of the Nymphs, a great boulder hollow inside

	2. The statues of the Nymphs themselves
	were made of stones, with feet unshod, arms bare to
	the shoulders, tresses loose on their necks, a belt around
	the waist, a smile upon the face. The whole arrangement
	was of dancers in circular motion.

	up from a spring created a running stream, so that
	before the cave stretched a silky meadow, thick with soft
	grass nourished by the moisture. Hung on the walls were
	milk pails, transverse flutes, panpipes, and staffs, offerings
	of bygone shepherds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A newly lambed ewe kept visiting this shrine of the [c dimgray]5[/c]
	Nymphs, often making it seem that she had vanished.
	Meaning to punish her and recall her to her former good
	behavior, he twisted a green switch into a halter like a
	snare and went off to the boulder hoping to catch her
	there.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But on arrival he did not see at all what he expected:
	no, he saw the ewe in quite human fashion offering
	her teat for unstinted sucking of milk, and the child, without
	a whimper, eagerly applying to one teat and then the
	other a mouth clean and shiny, as the ewe licked off its face
	with her tongue when it had fed enough.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This child was
	female, and lying beside it too were tokens of identity: a
	headband threaded with gold, gilded sandals, and anklets
	of solid gold.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thinking his discovery something divine, and learning [c dimgray]6[/c]
	from the ewe to feel compassion and love for the child, he
	picked up the baby in the crook of his arm, packed the tokens
	in his knapsack, and asked the Nymphs in prayer to
	favor with good luck his rearing of their suppliant.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. And when it was time to drive his flock home, he returned to his
	farmhouse and told his wife what he had seen, showed her
	what he had found, and urged her to regard it as a little
	daughter and raise it, as far as anyone knew, as her own.

	and loved the child, as though frightened of being
	outshone by the ewe, and for credibility she too gave the
	child a pastoral name: Chloe.[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These children grew very rapidly and their beauty conspicuously [c dimgray]7[/c]
	surpassed the rural norm. The boy was now fifteen
	years of age and the girl just two years younger, when
	in the very same night Dryas and Lamo had the following
	dream.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They dreamed that those Nymphs in the cave
	where the spring was, where Dryas had found the baby,
	were handing Daphnis and Chloe over to a very headstrong
	and handsome boy sporting wings on his shoulders
	and carrying a small bow and arrows, who lightly touched
	them both with a single arrow and ordered them henceforth
	to tend the flocks, he the goats and she the sheep.[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Both were depressed by the vision of this dream, if it [c dimgray]8[/c]
	meant that they were to be mere shepherds and goatherds
	who from swaddling had shown promise of a better future—
	the reason why they had raised them on daintier
	fare and taught them reading and writing and whatever refinements
	a country life held; but they decided to obey the
	gods in the case of those saved by the gods’ providence.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So they shared the dream with each other and in the
	Nymphs’ shrine made an offering to the winged boy (they
	did not know what to call him), and then sent them forth
	with the flocks as shepherds, after instructing them in every
	particular: how they should let them graze before midday,
	how to graze them again after the midday heat has
	abated, when to take them for a drink, when to bring them
	home to sleep, on which ones to use the staff, on which
	ones the voice alone.

	newborn sheep; lambs gamboled on the hills, bees buzzed
	in the meadows, birds enchanted the thickets.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Such was
	the season’s beauty that filled the world, and being tender
	and young they began to mimic its sights and sounds: hearing
	the birds sing, they sang; seeing the lambs gambol, they
	skipped nimbly; and mimicking the bees, they gathered
	flowers, putting some inside their clothes and weaving
	others into garlands to bring to the Nymphs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	They did everything together, pasturing their flocks [c dimgray]10[/c]
	side by side. Often would Daphnis round up sheep that
	strayed, and often would Chloe drive the bolder goats
	down from the cliffs; it also happened that one would mind
	both flocks while the other was busy with a pastime.

	2. Their pastimes were pastoral and childlike: she would collect
	stalks of asphodel here and there and weave a locusttrap,[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]
	ignoring the sheep as she worked at it; he would cut
	tender reeds, punch holes in the clefts at the joints, join
	them with soft wax, and practice playing the syrinx until
	nightfall.[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]

	parted from one another than Chloe and Daphnis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While they played at these pastimes, Love fashioned a [c dimgray]11[/c]
	serious development. A she-wolf with young cubs to feed
	was carrying off lots of sheep from other flocks on the
	neighboring farms, since she needed lots of food for raising
	her cubs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So the villagers gathered one night and dug
	pits six feet wide and twenty-four feet deep. Most of the
	dug soil they carried off and scattered at a distance, and
	then they put long dry sticks over the hole and spread the
	rest of the soil on top to make it look like the ground looked
	before, so that if even a hare ran over them it would snap
	the sticks, which were flimsier than straw, and then would
	have found out that it was not ground but a semblance of
	ground. They dug many such pits both in the hills and on
	the plains, and while they had no luck in catching the she-wolf
	(a wolf recognizes specious ground), they did destroy
	lots of goats and sheep, and almost Daphnis too, in the
	following way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Two he-goats got worked up and fell to fighting. In an [c dimgray]12[/c]
	especially violent clash, one of them had a horn broken and
	took to flight, bucking in pain, but the victor followed close
	on his heels and kept him on the run. Daphnis was upset
	about the horn and annoyed at such impetuosity, so grabbing
	a stick and his staff he took off in pursuit of the pursuer.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. What with one trying to get away and the other in
	furious pursuit, there was no close attention to what lay
	underfoot and both fell into a pit, first the goat and then
	Daphnis. What saved Daphnis’ life was using the goat as a
	vehicle on the way down.

	who might show up to pull him up, and Chloe, who had
	seen the accident, came running to the pit, and finding that
	he was alive hailed a cowherd from the neighboring farm
	for help.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He came and cast about for a long rope that
	Daphnis could hold onto and be pulled up. There was no
	rope, but Chloe undid her breast-band and gave it to the
	cowherd to let down. So they stood at the edge and pulled,
	and he ascended, following with both hands their pulls on
	the breast-band.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. They also pulled up the poor goat, with
	both its horns broken: such then was its penalty in the matter
	of the vanquished goat. As a life-saver’s reward they
	presented it to the goatherd to sacrifice, and in case anyone
	missed it they made up a story to tell their families
	about an attack by wolves. They themselves went back and
	looked over their herd and flock, and when they found
	the goats and the sheep grazing properly, they sat by the
	trunk of an oak tree and checked to be sure that in his fall
	Daphnis had not bloodied any part of his body.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. In fact he
	had not been wounded at all and there was no trace of
	blood, but he was caked with dirt and mud in his hair and
	all over his body. It seemed best to wash before Lamo and
	Myrtale found out what had happened.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He went with Chloe to the Nymphs’ shrine and gave [c dimgray]13[/c]
	her his shirt and his knapsack to look after, while he stood
	by the spring and began washing his hair and his whole
	body.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. His hair was dark and thick, his body tanned by the
	sun—one might have supposed it colored by the shadow of
	his hair. As Chloe watched, Daphnis seemed beautiful,
	and
	since he seemed beautiful to her for the first time, she
	thought the washing was the cause of the beauty. And

	3. At that point
	they drove their flocks home (by now the sun was setting),
	and Chloe had experienced nothing extraordinary except
	that she longed to see Daphnis washing again.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When
	they got to the pasture next day, Daphnis sat beneath the
	usual oak and played the syrinx while he watched his goats
	that lay about as if listening to the tunes; Chloe sat nearby
	and kept an eye on her flock of sheep, but mostly she was
	looking at Daphnis. As he played he once again seemed to
	her beautiful, and this time she thought the music was the
	cause of the beauty. And so when he had finished she
	picked up the syrinx herself, hoping that she too might
	become beautiful.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. She also persuaded him to have another
	wash, and she watched him while he washed, and
	after watching she touched him, and again she came away
	in admiration, and that admiration was the beginning of
	love. She did not know what was happening to her, being
	but a young girl raised in the country, who had never even
	heard anyone speak of love. Her heart began to ache, she
	could not control her eyes, she was always talking about
	Daphnis.

	she neglected her flock. Now she would be laughing, now

	pale and then blush red. Not even a cow stung by a gadfly

	2. How often have brambles scratched me,

	beautiful, but so are the flowers; his syrinx sounds beautiful,
	but so do the nightingales. And yet they are nothing
	special to me.

	less notice of Daphnis, but every day he would bring Chloe
	soft cheese or a garland of flowers or a ripe apple. One day
	he brought her a newborn calf, a wooden ivy-bowl inlaid
	with gold,[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] and some nestling mountain birds. Being unfamiliar
	with a lover’s technique, she was happy to receive
	the gifts, and even happier that she herself had something
	to give Daphnis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. One day, for now it was Daphnis’ turn
	to discover what love does, Dorco got into a beauty contest
	with him. Chloe would be the judge, and the victor’s prize
	would be to kiss Chloe. Dorco spoke first:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“I, my girl, am bigger than Daphnis, and I’m a cowherd [c dimgray]16[/c]
	while he’s a goatherd, so I’m as superior to him as cows are
	to goats. I’m as white as milk and my hair is ruddy like a
	cornfield ready for reaping. And a mother raised me, not a
	beast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But this fellow is short <like a boy>, beardless like
	a woman, and dark like a wolf. He tends he-goats and
	smells terrible himself, and he’s too poor to keep even a
	dog. And if what they say is true, that a goat suckled him,
	he’s really no better than a kid.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This and the like from
	Dorco, and then it was Daphnis’ turn: “A goat did nurse
	me, just like Zeus,[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] and the goats I tend are bigger than his
	cows. I don’t smell of them at all, because Pan doesn’t either,
	and he’s mostly goat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. And I have plenty of cheese,
	bread baked on a spit, and white[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] wine—the sort of goods
	that make countrymen rich. I’m beardless, but so is Dionysus;
	dark, and so is the hyacinth. And yet Dionysus is better

	5. But this
	fellow is ruddy like a fox, goateed like a goat, and white like
	a townswoman. And if you must kiss someone, you can kiss
	my mouth but only the hairs on his chin. Remember, my
	girl, that a sheep nursed you, but you are beautiful.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Chloe delayed no longer, but delighted by his homage [c dimgray]17[/c]
	and anyway having long yearned to kiss him, she jumped
	up and gave him a kiss, untrained and artless but with
	power to inflame a soul.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So Dorco ran off in pain, looking
	for another route to love, while Daphnis, as if not kissed
	but rather stung, was from that moment a sullen sort; he
	kept getting chills and kept trying to control his pounding
	heart; he wanted to look at Chloe but when he looked he
	blushed all over.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. That was the first time he saw with wonder
	that her hair was blonde, her eyes as big as a cow’s, her
	face truly whiter even than goats’ milk, as if that was the
	first time he had eyes to see and hadn’t eyes before.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So
	he took no food except a mere taste, and if he had to drink
	he took only enough to moisten his lips. Before, he had
	been more chatty than a locust, but now he was taciturn;
	before, he had been busier than the goats, but now he was
	listless. His flock was neglected, his syrinx tossed aside, his
	face paler than summer grass. He was chatty only with
	Chloe, and if ever he was alone without her, he would prattle
	to himself this way:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“What in the world is Chloe’s kiss doing to me? Her lips [c dimgray]18[/c]
	are softer than rose petals and her mouth is sweeter than
	honeycombs, but her kiss is sharper than a bee sting. I have

	the calf that was Dorco’s gift. But this kiss is something
	strange: my breath is surging, my heart is leaping, my soul
	is melting away, and yet I want to kiss her again. What a
	malign victory, what a strange sickness; I don’t even know
	what to call it. Did Chloe sip poison just before she kissed
	me? Then how come she didn’t die? How the nightingales
	are singing, and my syrinx is silent! How the kids are frisking
	about, and I sit still! How the flowers bloom, and I
	weave no garlands. The violets and the hyacinth flower,
	and Daphnis withers. Will even Dorco be looking handsomer
	than me?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this manner did that fine fellow Daphnis suffer and [c dimgray]19[/c]
	speak upon first tasting love’s effects and expressions. But
	Dorco, Chloe’s cowherd suitor, waited until Dryas was
	planting a tree beside a vine slip and went over to him with
	some fine little cheeses. These he gave as a present, being
	his old friend from the days when Dryas herded cattle
	himself. He followed this opener by broaching the subject
	of Chloe’s marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. He promised a cowherd’s plethora
	of great gifts if he got her as his wife: a yoke of plough oxen,
	four swarms of bees, fifty apple trees, a bull’s hide to cut up
	for shoes, and a weaned calf annually.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Dryas, charmed
	by these gifts, very nearly consented to the marriage. But
	he reckoned that the girl deserved a better bridegroom
	and feared that one day he would be found out and get into
	desperate trouble, so he rejected the marriage, begged
	pardon, and declined the proffered gifts.

	Chloe into his clutches when she was alone. Noticing that
	they drove their flocks to drink on alternate days, one day
	Daphnis and the next day the girl, he worked out a stratagem
	befitting a herdsman.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. He got the skin of a big wolf
	that a bull once gored to death in defense of his cows and
	stretched it over his back, wrapping it around his body
	down to his toes so that the forepaws spread over his hands
	and the hind paws over his legs down to the heels, and the
	gaping maw covered his head like an infantryman’s helmet.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Having turned himself into a beast as best he could, he
	went to the spring where the goats and sheep drank after
	grazing. The spring was in a deep hollow, and the whole
	area around it grew wild with thorns, brambles, dwarf juniper,
	and thistles.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Even a real wolf could easily have
	lurked there unseen. Dorco hid himself in that spot and
	waited for watering time, very confident that he would
	scare Chloe with his disguise and get her into his clutches.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In a little while, Chloe left Daphnis cutting green [c dimgray]21[/c]
	leaves as fodder for the kids and began driving her flocks to
	the spring.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The dogs that went with her to guard the
	sheep and goats, with typical canine nosiness in tracking a
	scent, got wind of Dorco as he moved on the girl and, barking
	deafeningly, rushed at him as at a wolf. Before his panic
	allowed him to stand fully upright, they were all over him
	and biting away at the skin.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. For a while he lay mute in his
	copse, embarrassed at the prospect of exposure and still
	protected by the skin that covered him; but when Chloe,
	quite spooked by her first sight of him, started calling
	Daphnis to help and the dogs pulled off the skin and began

	4. Calling off the dogs in their usual way they quickly quieted
	them, and Dorco, bitten on the thighs and shoulders, they
	led to the spring and washed his bites clean, and chewed
	some green elm bark to daub on them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. In their innocence
	of amorous adventures they regarded the skin costume
	as a pastoral game, so they were not at all angry and
	even tried to cheer him up, and they led him by the hand
	for a while before sending him on his way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After so narrow a brush with danger, and safely [c dimgray]22[/c]
	snatched from the jaws of a dog (not the proverbial wolf),
	Dorco nursed his wounds, while Daphnis and Chloe were
	kept hard at work till nightfall rounding up the she-goats
	and the ewes;
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. for panicked by the skin and startled by
	the baying of the dogs, some had run up cliffs and others
	had run down all the way to the sea. They were trained to
	obey the human voice, to be calmed by the syrinx, and to
	gather at a hand-clap, yet on that occasion their fright had
	consigned everything to oblivion.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. It took some doing to
	track them down like hares and drive them into their folds.
	That night, for once, they slept soundly, and in weariness
	had relief from the pain of love.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. But when daylight returned
	their feelings were much the same as before: they
	were happy to see one another and sad to be apart; they
	wanted something but did not know what they wanted.
	They knew only that a kiss had been his undoing, and a
	bath hers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The time of year inflamed them too. It was now the end [c dimgray]23[/c]

	of spring and the start of summer, and everything was in its
	prime: fruit in the trees, crops in the fields. Pleasant was
	the sound of cicadas, sweet the fragrance of fruit, delightful
	the bleating of sheep.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. One would have thought that
	the very rivers sang as they flowed gently along, the winds
	made syrinx-music as they blew through the pines, the
	apples swooned to the ground from love, and the sun in liking
	for beauty made everyone undress. So Daphnis, made
	hot by all this, took to wading into rivers; sometimes he
	bathed, sometimes he tried to catch the fish that swirled
	around him, and often he drank the water, hoping to
	quench the burning within him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. And Chloe, after milking
	the ewes and most of the she-goats, took a long time
	pressing the milk into cheese, for the flies were awful,
	plaguing her and biting if <not> shooed away; then she
	would wash her face, adorn her head with pine twigs, put
	her fawnskin around her waist, fill her pail with wine and
	milk, and share a drink with Daphnis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When midday came they fell prey to each other’s eyes. [c dimgray]24[/c]
	Beholding Daphnis naked, she would succumb to his overwhelming
	beauty and melt away, unable to fault any part of
	him; and seeing her in fawn skin and pine garland offering
	the pail, he would imagine that he beheld one of the
	Nymphs from the cave.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So he would snatch the pine garland
	from her head and put it on his own, after giving the
	garland a kiss; and when he was bathing and undressed,
	she would put on his clothes, after likewise giving them a
	kiss.

	3. Occasionally they also pelted each other with apples
	and spruced up their heads by combing each other’s
	hair. She compared Daphnis’ hair to myrtle berries because

	4. He also began to teach her
	to play the syrinx, and when she started to blow into it he
	would snatch the syrinx away and run his own lips over it;
	he gave the impression of correcting her mistakes, but by
	proxy of the syrinx he was giving Chloe kisses.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While he played the syrinx at midday and the flocks [c dimgray]25[/c]
	took to the shade, Chloe fell asleep unobserved. Noticing
	this, Daphnis put down his syrinx and, fearing no embarrassment,
	looked her all over insatiably and quietly whispered,

	2. “Such eyes sleep here! Such a breath from this
	Mouth—not even apples, not even pears can match it! But
	I’m afraid to kiss: her kiss stings my heart and, like new
	honey, drives me mad, and I worry that a kiss will wake her.

	with all their loud noise. And the goats too, slamming their

	for not having carried them off!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As he went on with these pronouncements a cicada, on [c dimgray]26[/c]
	the run from a swallow looking to capture it, dropped into

	which still wanted to sleep.

	One day a wood pigeon entertained them from the [c dimgray]27[/c]

	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “Once, my girl, there was a girl
	as beautiful as you who herded many cows in a wood, just
	as you do. She was a singer too, and her cows were entertained
	by her music; she herded them not by the stroke of
	a crook or the prod of a goad, but sitting beneath a pine
	and garlanded with pine twigs she would sing of Pan and
	Pitys,[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] and the cows stayed in range of her voice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Not far
	off a boy herded cows, and he too was fair and a singer like
	the girl. He vied with her in singing and countered with a
	voice as strong as a man’s but as sweet as a boy’s, and
	charming her eight best cows into his own herd he herded
	them away.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The girl was distressed at the loss to her
	herd, the defeat of her song, and prayed to the gods to become
	a bird before she got home. The gods granted her
	prayer and turned her into this bird, a dweller in the mountains
	like the girl and musical like her. And to this day her
	song recounts her misfortune, that she is looking for her
	stray cows.”

	with cutlasses and breastplates and started pillaging everything
	that came to hand: fragrant wine, plentiful wheat,
	honey in the combs. They also rustled some cows from
	Dorco’s herd.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. And they caught Daphnis as he wandered
	by the seashore, for Chloe was driving Dryas’ sheep out
	more slowly, being a girl and wary of the headstrong shepherds.
	Spotting a tall, handsome lad worth more than their
	plunder from the farm, they lost all interest in the goats
	and the other farms and marched him onto their ship, wailing
	desperately and calling loudly for Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. No sooner
	had they untied the mooring rope, dipped their oars, and
	started to sail out to sea than Chloe came driving her flock
	down, carrying a new syrinx as a present for Daphnis.
	When she saw the goats scattered and heard Daphnis ever
	more loudly yelling for her, she forgot about her sheep,
	dropped the syrinx, and ran off to Dorco to ask for help.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But he was lying on the ground, thoroughly battered [c dimgray]29[/c]
	by the pirates’ lusty blows, scarcely breathing and losing a
	lot of blood. When he saw Chloe he briefly held onto a
	spark of warmth from his earlier passion and said, “Chloe,
	I will soon be dead—as I defended my cows those impious
	pirates butchered me like a cow—but you must rescue

	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]Tyrian pirates appear in other Greek novels, and the Carian
	cutter (“one-and-one-half boat”) was a typical pirate craft (one bank of oars was modified to facilitate grappling). Tyre, a city on
	the Phoenician coast, was an important Hellenistic and Roman
	capital, and Caria, the southwest region of modern Turkey, had
	long since been hellenized, but Longus evidently thought of Caria
	as barbarian, unless the phrase about barbarians is spurious (it
	may have originated as a gloss). In any case there is no need to
	emend “Tyrian” to “Pyrrhaean,” i.e. from Pyrrha, a town on
	Lesbos and an unlikely venue for pirates.

	2. I taught my
	cattle to attend to the sound of the syrinx and follow its
	tune however far away they might be grazing. Here, take
	this syrinx and breathe into it the tune that I once taught
	Daphnis and Daphnis taught you. What happens next will
	be up to the syrinx and the cattle out there.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The syrinx itself
	is my gift to you; with it I won competitions against
	many cowherds and shepherds. In return for all this, give
	me a kiss while I’m still alive and weep for me when I’m
	dead, and if you see someone else grazing my cattle, remember
	me.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With these words Dorco kissed his last kiss and, along [c dimgray]30[/c]
	with the kiss and his voice, took leave of his life. Chloe took
	the syrinx, put it to her lips, and began playing as loudly as
	she could. The cattle heard and recognized the tune, and
	in a concerted charge lunged mooing into the sea.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. What
	with a violent lunge to one side of the ship and a trough
	opened in the sea from the plunge of the cattle, the ship
	capsized and sank as the waves met. Those aboard fell in,
	with unequal chances to survive:

	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So
	the pirates swam only a short way before their gear pulled
	them to the bottom, while Daphnis easily shucked his
	clothes, though the swim tired him, since he had swum
	only in rivers before.

	what had to be done: he plunged into the midst of
	the cattle, grabbed two horns of two cattle in his \[two\]

	any person, bettered only by waterfowl and fish themselves.
	A cow would never drown while swimming unless
	its hooves got waterlogged and dropped off. To this day,

	In this way Daphnis was saved, rescued against all hope [c dimgray]31[/c]
	from two hazards, piracy and shipwreck. He emerged to
	find Chloe on shore, laughing and crying at the same time.
	He fell into her arms and wanted to know her reason for
	playing the syrinx.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. She told him the whole story: her
	dash to Dorco, the cattle’s training, how she was told to
	play the syrinx, and that Dorco was dead; she only omitted
	the kiss, feeling embarrassed. They thought it right
	to honor their benefactor, so they went with his relatives
	and buried poor Dorco.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. They put ample earth on his
	grave, planted many cultivated trees, and dedicated the
	first fruits of their labors to him. They also poured libations
	of milk, crushed some grapes, and broke many syrinxes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. There was the sound of cattle mooing in pity and the
	sight of them running in disorder as they mooed; all this
	the shepherds and herdsmen imagined was the cattle’s
	dirge for a deceased herdsman.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After Dorco’s burial Chloe took Daphnis to the [c dimgray]32[/c]
	Nymphs, took him into the cave and bathed him, and for
	the first time she bathed her own body while Daphnis was
	looking. It was white and pure in its beauty, needing no

	on the ground, not grazing or bleating but I think missing

	With the fruit season now at its peak and vintage-time [c dimgray]1[/c]
	drawing near, everyone was busy on the farms. Some repaired
	wine presses, some scrubbed jars, some plaited baskets;
	[m1]\ [/m]

	grapes, someone else to a stone fit for crushing the juice
	from the clusters, another to a dry willow twig, pounded
	into shreds, by whose light the must could be drawn after
	dark.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. So Daphnis and Chloe stopped tending their
	goats and sheep and lent the others a helping hand: he
	hoisted bunches of grapes in baskets, dumped them into
	the presses and trod them, and collected the wine into the
	jars, while she made meals for the vintners, poured them a
	drink of more mature wine, and harvested the fruit from
	the vines nearer the ground.[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]

	4. Indeed every vine on
	Lesbos is near the ground, not high up or trained on trees
	but trailing its shoots downwards and creeping like ivy.
	Even a baby with its hands barely free of swaddling clothes
	could reach a cluster.

	the equal of Dionysus in beauty; one of the more forward
	ones even kissed him, which excited Daphnis but pained
	Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Meanwhile the men in the wine presses flung
	manifold compliments at Chloe and pranced madly about
	her like satyrs about a maenad, praying to be turned into
	sheep and pastured by her, so that now she was pleased
	and he was pained.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. They prayed for the vintage to be
	finished quickly, so that they could return to their usual
	haunts and instead of discordant shouting hear the syrin
	Xor the bleating of their own flocks.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. A few days later the
	vines were harvested, the juice was in the jars, and there
	was no further need of many hands, so they drove their
	flocks down to the plain and joyfully paid obeisance to the
	Nymphs, bringing them bunches of grapes on the stem as
	first fruits of the vintage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Nor had they in time past ever
	passed by neglectfully but at the start of each day’s pasturing
	they would pay their respects, and when they returned
	from the pasture they would make obeisance and never fail
	to offer them something: a flower, fruit, green leaves, or a
	libation of milk.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. For this they received a reward from the
	goddesses later on, but for now they were like dogs off the
	leash, as they say, frisking, playing the syrinx, singing, and
	romping with their goats and sheep.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While they were enjoying themselves an old man approached [c dimgray]3[/c]
	clad in a goat-skin jacket, with rawhide sandals
	on his feet and a bag slung from his shoulder, and a very old
	bag it was. He sat down beside them and said,

	Nymphs, and many a tune have I played for Pan over there,
	and many the herd of cattle that I have herded by music
	alone. I have come to disclose to you what I have seen and
	to pass on to you what I have heard.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. I have a garden,
	made by my own hands, that I have worked on ever since I
	retired from being a herdsman on account of old age. It has
	everything that the seasons produce in its due season:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. in
	spring roses, lilies, hyacinth, both kinds of violet; in summer
	poppies, wild pears, and every kind of apple; and currently
	vines, figs, pomegranates, and green myrtle berries.
	In the morning flocks of birds gather in this garden, some
	for food and some for song, for it is sheltered, shady, and
	watered by three springs. If the stone fence were removed
	it would look to be a sacred grove.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“When I went into my garden around midday today, beneath [c dimgray]4[/c]
	the pomegranate trees and the myrtle bushes, I
	caught sight of a boy with pomegranates and myrtle berries
	in his hands, as pale as milk, as tawny-haired as fire,
	gleaming as if just bathed. He was unclothed, he was alone,
	he was having fun picking fruit as if the garden were his
	own.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So I lunged and tried to grab him, afraid that in his
	naughtiness he would damage my myrtle bushes and my
	pomegranate trees, but he kept dodging me nimbly and
	easily, now darting under the rose bushes, now hiding beneath
	the poppies like a partridge chick.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Well, I have often
	had trouble chasing unweaned kids and I have often
	worn myself out running after newborn calves, but this one
	was a complicated little thing and uncatchable. So being an
	old man, I got tired and, leaning on my stick while watching
	to see that he didn’t escape, I asked which of the neighbors
	he belonged to and what he meant by picking fruit in

	me and began to laugh very softly and to pelt me with
	myrtle berries, and somehow he charmed my anger away.
	So I encouraged him to embrace me and be frightened no
	more, and I swore by the myrtle berries that I would send
	him off with a gift of apples and pomegranates and give
	him permission to pick the fruit and pluck the flowers any
	time he wanted, if I could get one kiss from him.

	“At that, with clear silvery laughter he produced a voice [c dimgray]5[/c]
	that no swallow owns, no nightingale, no swan grown old
	like me. ‘For my part, Philetas, it is no trouble to kiss you,
	for I want to be kissed more than you want to grow young
	again, but do consider whether the gift is appropriate at
	your age.

	2. Your old age will not help you resist stalking
	me after that one kiss. I am hard to catch even for a hawk or
	an eagle, or any other bird that may be swifter than they
	are. I am not really a boy, even though I look like a boy, but
	senior even to Cronus and time itself.[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]

	cattle on that mountain there, and I was with you when you

	though I stood right next to the girl. It was I who gave her
	to you, and now you have sons, fine shepherds and farmers.

	4. At present I am shepherd to Daphnis and Chloe, and
	when I herd them together in the morning, I come to your

	5. I was soul-sick, my
	heart throbbed, my body was frozen. I would scream as if
	beaten, I fell as quiet as a dying man, I plunged into rivers
	as if on fire.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. I would call on Pan for help, since he himself
	had been in love with Pitys. I would praise Echo for
	repeating Amaryllis’ name after me. I would smash my

	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Philetas had given them this lesson he went on [c dimgray]8[/c]
	his way, accepting from them some cheeses and a kid that
	already had its horns, while they were left on their own,
	having heard Love’s name for the very first time. Their
	souls were painfully downcast, and when they returned to
	their farms that night they compared their own experiences
	with what they had heard.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “Lovers are in pain, and
	so are we. They neglect food: we have neglected it likewise.
	They cannot sleep, and now that is happening to us
	too. They think they’re burning up: that fire is in us too.
	They long to see each other, and that is why we pray for the
	day to come sooner.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This must be love and we must be in
	love with each other without realizing it. Or maybe this is
	love and I am the only one in love? Then why do we feel the
	same pain? Why do we seek after each other? Everything
	that Philetas said is true.

	5. We must run to
	the Nymphs for help. But Pan didn’t even help Philetas
	when he was in love with Amaryllis. Those remedies he
	mentioned, we must look for them: kissing, embracing,
	and lying naked on the ground. It’s icy, but we will endure
	it, following Philetas’ example.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That was their nocturnal lesson, and the next day, as [c dimgray]9[/c]
	they led their flocks to pasture, they kissed each other on
	sight, which they had never done before, and threw their
	arms around each other tightly, but they balked at the third
	remedy, undressing and lying down: that was too bold not
	only for girls but also for young goatherds.

	2. So another
	night of insomnia, thinking over what had happened, and
	remorse for what had been left undone. “We kissed, and
	that was no help. We embraced, and that was no better.
	Lying down together must be the only remedy for love. We
	must try that too: there will certainly be something in it
	more potent than kissing.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After these calculations they naturally had erotic [c dimgray]10[/c]
	dreams about their kisses and embraces, and what they
	had not done by day they did in their dreams: they lay
	naked with each other.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They got up next morning even
	more possessed, and whistled their flocks down in eagerness
	for kisses, and on sight they ran to each other with a
	smile.

	but the third remedy took its time, since Daphnis

	Sitting close beside each other by the trunk of an oak, [c dimgray]11[/c]
	they tasted the delight of kissing and kept indulging in that

	Daphnis hugged Chloe rather forcefully, she somehow

	for their table. Whatever else they needed they got
	from the country people, paying more money than it was
	worth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. They needed only bread, wine, and shelter, for
	they thought it unsafe to stay at sea with autumn set in and
	would even beach their yacht if they feared a stormy night.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now one of the farmers needed a rope, his own having [c dimgray]13[/c]
	broken, for hoisting a stone being used to crush the grapes
	after treading. So he stole down to the shore, approached
	the yacht, which had been left unguarded, untied her cable,
	took it home, and used it for what he needed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Next
	morning the young men from Methymna launched an inquiry
	after the rope, and when no one would own up to the
	theft they made a few complaints about their hosts and
	sailed on. After cruising thirty stades[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] they put in at the
	farm where Daphnis and Chloe lived, for this plain seemed
	to them a fine spot for hunting hares.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. But since they had
	no rope to use as a mooring cable, they plaited a long,
	green willow shoot for a rope, used it to moor the yacht’s
	stern to land, then released their hounds to pick up a scent
	and started setting out nets on the paths that looked promising.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The hounds ran around baying and frightened the
	goats, which left the high ground and rushed down to the
	shore. Having nothing to eat on shore, the bolder ones
	went over to the yacht and ate up the green willow shoot
	that moored it.

	the backwash of the surf lifted her and took her
	out to the open sea.

	2. When this news reached the Methymnaeans,
	some went running to the shore, the rest collected
	the hounds, and all were shouting, so that everyone
	from the neighboring farms heard them and arrived on the
	scene en masse. But it was no use: the breeze was at its
	peak and the backwash carried the yacht away with irresistible
	speed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The Methymnaeans had lost no trivial
	amount of property, so they went looking for the person in
	charge of those goats. When they found Daphnis they
	started beating him and stripping off his clothes, and one
	of them even picked up a dog-leash and started pulling his
	hands behind his back to tie him up.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He screamed as he
	was beaten and appealed to the farmers, calling first of all
	on Lamo and Dryas for help. And they held their own, being
	hard old men with hands strengthened by farm work,
	and demanded a judicial inquiry into the events.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The other side made the same demand, so they appointed [c dimgray]15[/c]
	Philetas the cowherd as judge: he was the most
	venerable person there and among the villagers owned a
	reputation for exceptional fairness. First the Methymnaeans
	argued the case for the prosecution, making it plain
	and simple for their herdsman judge:

	2. “We came to these
	fields to do some hunting. We moored our yacht with green
	willow and left her on the beach while we set our hounds
	on the quest for game. Meanwhile, this fellow’s goats came
	down to the shore, ate up the willow, and cast the yacht
	adrift.

	3. You saw her drifting on the sea. Have you any idea

	the right to carry off this bungling goatherd, who tends his
	goats like a sailor.”[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such was the Methymnaeans’ case for the prosecution.[c dimgray]16[/c]
	Daphnis was in a bad way from his beating but when he
	saw Chloe there, he disregarded all that and said, “I graze
	my goats just fine. Never has a single villager ever complained
	that a goat of mine has eaten up anyone’s garden or
	trampled a budding vine.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. These hunters are the bunglers,
	with their poorly trained hounds that chased the
	goats off the hills and plains down to the shore by running
	all about and baying harshly, like wolves.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Item: they ate
	the willow. Yes, because on the beach they had no grass, arbutus,
	or thyme. Item: the yacht was lost because of the
	wind and the sea. Yes, that was the work of a storm, not
	goats. Item: clothing and money were on board. But who
	in their right mind will believe that a yacht with such a
	cargo had a willow shoot for a mooring cable?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To this Daphnis added a burst of tears and made the [c dimgray]17[/c]
	country folk feel very sorry for him. And so Philetas the
	judge swore by Pan and the Nymphs that Daphnis had
	done no wrong and neither had the goats, but rather the
	sea and the wind, who were answerable to different
	judges.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. This verdict of Philetas did not satisfy the Methymnaeans,:
	they angrily charged at Daphnis and again
	started to take him away and were ready to tie him up.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Here the villagers got stirred up and lit into them like starlings
	or jackdaws. They soon reclaimed Daphnis, who was
	now fighting too, and soon routed them with cudgel-blows,

	in which case we might translate “who is like a sailor at sea tending
	billow-goats.”

	While they were chasing the Methymnaeans, Chloe [c dimgray]18[/c]
	took Daphnis in very calm circumstances to the Nymphs,
	where she washed from his face the blood from his nose,
	broken by a punch, and gave him from her knapsack a
	piece of leavened bread and a slice of cheese to eat. But
	what most revived him was the kiss she gave him, sweet as
	honey, with her soft lips.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So narrow was Daphnis’ escape from harm that day. [c dimgray]19[/c]
	But the matter did not end there: when the Methymnaeans
	returned home the hard way, trekkers instead of
	sailors, casualties instead of voluptuaries, they convened
	an assembly of the citizens and, placing olive branches, petitioned
	to be accorded vengeance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. In their account they
	spoke not a word of truth, for fear that on top of everything
	else they would become laughing-stocks for having been
	foiled in so many ways by shepherds. Instead, they accused
	the Mitylenaeans of seizing their yacht and plundering
	their possessions in an act of war.

	3. The assemblymen
	were convinced by their wounds and thought it right to
	avenge young men from the leading families in town, so
	they voted for an undeclared war against the Mitylenaeans
	and authorized the commander to launch ten ships to ravage
	their coast: with winter approaching, it was unsafe to
	commit a larger fleet to the sea.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	blitz landing and plundered whatever he found. Daphnis
	was not grazing his goats but had gone up to the woods and
	was chopping green leaves so that he would have food for

	was with her flocks, and when they started to chase her
	fled for sanctuary to the Nymphs, where she pleaded with
	them in the name of the goddesses to spare her flocks and
	herself. But it was no use: pouring scorn on the statues, the
	Methymnaeans drove off her flocks and led her away too,
	whipping her with willow shoots like a goat or a sheep.

	Now that they had filled their ships with all kinds of [c dimgray]21[/c]

	5. Do not be downcast, but get up
	and show yourself to Lamo and Myrtale, who are also lying
	on the ground, thinking that you are also part of the plunder.
	Tomorrow Chloe will return to you with the goats,
	with the sheep, and you will graze them together and play
	the syrinx together. As for the rest, Love will take care
	of you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Daphnis saw and heard this, he bolted up from [c dimgray]24[/c]
	his slumbers and, weeping all at once with pleasure and
	pain, knelt before the Nymphs and promised to sacrifice
	the finest of his she-goats if Chloe were rescued.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. And he
	ran to the pine tree where Pan’s statue was set up, goat-legged
	and horned, with a syrinx in one hand and a frisking
	he-goat in the other, and knelt before him too, prayed for
	Chloe, and promised to sacrifice a he-goat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Only around
	sunset did he finally stop weeping and praying, and then he
	picked up the leaves that he had cut and went back to the
	farmhouse, relieving Lamo and his family of grief and filling
	them with joy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He had something to eat and went
	straight to sleep, though not even that sleep was without
	tears, while he prayed to see the Nymphs again in a dream
	and prayed for the quick arrival of the day when they had
	promised him Chloe. Of all nights ever, that one seemed
	the longest, and during that night here is what happened.

	After sailing for about ten stades,[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] the Methymnaean [c dimgray]25[/c]
	commander decided to rest his troops, who were tired out
	after their raid.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So he made for a long crescent-shaped 25
	cape jutting into the deep, in which the sea formed a haven
	stiller than any harbor, and there brought his ships to anchor
	off shore, so that none would be damaged from land

	by the farmers, and then gave the Methymnaeans leave for
	peaceful recreation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Having plenty of everything from
	their plunder, they started drinking, carousing, and aping a
	victory celebration. Just as day was ending and the recreation
	was tapering off for the night, the whole landscape
	seemed to burst into flame, and the sound of oars splashing
	could be heard, as of a huge fleet on the attack.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Someone gave the call to arms, someone else summoned
	the commander; here someone looked to be wounded,
	there someone lay in an attitude suggesting a corpse. An
	observer would have imagined a night battle, although no
	enemy was at hand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such was their night, but the day that followed was [c dimgray]26[/c]
	much more terrifying than the night. Daphnis’ he-goats
	and she-goats sported ivy with clusters on their horns, and
	Chloe’s rams and ewes were howling like wolves.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. She herself was seen wearing a crown of pine. About the sea itself
	many extraordinary things were happening too: their
	anchors stuck to the seabed when they tried to raise them,
	their oars broke off when they lowered them to row, and
	dolphins leaping from the water struck the ships with their
	tails and loosened the timber joints.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. And over the sheer
	cliff beneath the cape came the sound of a syrinx, but it
	did not give pleasure like a syrinx but brought fear like a
	bugle.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Of course they were rattled, ran for their weapons,
	and called the enemy those they could not see, so that
	they prayed for the return of night in hope of making a
	truce then.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. But the meaning of what had happened was
	clear to those who had their wits about them: the strange
	sights and sounds came from Pan because for some reason
	he was angry with the sailors. But they could not guess
	the reason, for no shrine of Pan had been plundered, until

	around midday the commander fell into an inspired
	trance, where Pan himself appeared and spoke:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“You most impious and ungodly of mankind, by what [c dimgray]27[/c]
	madness of heart have you dared such acts? You filled the
	countryside I love with war; you rustled herds of cattle,
	goats, and sheep under my care;
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. you dragged from a
	shrine a girl of whom Love intends to make a story; and you
	showed no respect for the Nymphs who looked on nor for
	me, Pan. If you set sail with such spoils you shall never see
	Methymna again, nor shall you escape this syrinx that rattled
	you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. No, I shall sink you and make you food for fish
	unless you return Chloe to the Nymphs at once, and the
	herds to Chloe, both the goats and the sheep. Get up now
	and put the girl ashore with the cargo I specified, and I will
	be your guide on your voyage and hers on her journey.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Very shaken, Bryaxis[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] (for that was the commander’s [c dimgray]28[/c]
	name) leapt up, summoned the ships’ captains, and ordered
	them to look for Chloe among the captives on the
	double.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They were quick to find her and bring her before
	him, for she sat wearing a crown of pine. Regarding
	this as confirmation of his dream vision, he brought her
	ashore in his own flagship.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Just as she disembarked, the
	sound of a syrinx was again heard from the cliff, this time
	not warlike and terrifying but pastoral and like the sound
	that leads flocks to pasture. The sheep ran down the gangplank
	skittering on their horny hooves, while the goats
	went much more confidently, being used to walking on
	precipices.

	These animals formed a circle around Chloe like a chorus, [c dimgray]29[/c]
	frisking and bleating and looking joyful, while the
	goats belonging to the other herdsmen, along with their
	sheep and cattle, stayed where they were in the ship’s
	hold, inasmuch as the tune worked no magic on them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. With everyone spellbound and praising Pan’s name came
	even more spellbinding sights in both elements.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. The
	Methymnaeans’ ships started to sail before they had raised
	the anchors, and the flagship was guided by a dolphin leaping
	from the water, while a very sweet sound of a syrin
	Xguided the goats and the sheep, though no one could see
	the player. And so the sheep and the goats moved forward
	in unison and grazed happily to the tune.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It was around the time of the second pasturing when [c dimgray]30[/c]
	Daphnis, from a high lookout, spotted the herds and
	Chloe. With a loud shout of “Nymphs and Pan!” he ran
	down to the plain, hugged Chloe, and collapsed in a dead
	faint.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Eventually revived by Chloe’s kisses and warming
	embraces, he went to their usual oak tree, sat beneath its
	trunk, and asked how she had managed to escape such a
	large enemy force.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. She told him the whole story: the
	goats’ ivy, the sheep’s howling, the pine sprouting on her
	head, the fire on the earth and the noise at sea, the two
	kinds of piping, martial and peaceful, the night of terror,
	how when she did not know a way home music had
	shown her the way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Recognizing the dream visions of the
	Nymphs and the work of Pan, Daphnis told his own story
	of what he had seen, what he had heard, that when on the
	brink of death the Nymphs had given him life.

	everything needed for a sacrifice, and in the meantime
	he rounded up the finest of his she-goats, garlanded her
	with ivy, just as they had appeared to the enemy, poured a
	libation of milk over her horns, and sacrificed her to the
	Nymphs. When he had hung and skinned her, he dedicated
	the skin.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Once Chloe and company were on hand, he lit a fire, [c dimgray]31[/c]
	boiled some of the meat and roasted the rest, offered the
	firstlings to the Nymphs and as a libation poured out a bowl
	of new wine. He spread out leaves for couches and then
	was occupied with food, drink, and fun. He kept an eye on
	the herds in case a wolf should attack them and do an enemy’s
	work.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They also sang some hymns for the Nymphs,
	compositions by shepherds of old. At nightfall they slept
	there in the field, and next day they turned their thoughts
	to Pan. Garlanding the chief goat of the flock with pine,
	they took him to the pine tree, poured a libation of wine
	over him, and praising the god’s name they sacrificed him,
	then hung him up and skinned him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. After roasting and
	boiling the meat, they set it out nearby upon the leaves in
	the meadow, but they pegged the skin, horns and all, to the
	pine tree facing the statue, a pastoral offering to a pastoral
	god. Again they offered the firstlings and poured a libation
	from a larger bowl. Chloe did the singing while Daphnis
	played the syrinx.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At this point they lay down and were eating when [c dimgray]32[/c]
	Philetas the cowherd came by chance onto the scene as he
	was bringing some small garlands for Pan and clusters of
	grapes still on their leafy stems. The youngest of his children,

	2. So they jumped up and helped him to garland
	Pan, then hung the vine stems from the pine boughs
	and made Philetas recline next to them and join the party.

	3. As old men do when tipsy, they started telling one another
	lots of stories: how they used to graze flocks when
	they were young, how they had dodged many a pirate raid;
	one boasted that he had killed a wolf, another that he was
	second only to Pan at playing the syrinx—this one was
	Philetas’ boast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So Daphnis and Chloe started pestering him with requests [c dimgray]33[/c]
	to share his art with them too, and to play the syrin
	Xat a party for a god who loved the syrinx. Philetas consented,
	though he complained that old age makes for short
	breath, and took up Daphnis’ syrinx.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But it was too small
	for his great artistry, being fit to be played on a boy’s lips. So
	he sent Tityrus for his own syrinx, his farm being ten stades
	distant.[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. He threw off his apron and without his clothes
	dashed away like a fawn. Meanwhile Lamo agreed to tell
	them the story of the syrinx, which a Sicilian goatherd had
	sung for him for the price of a goat and a syrinx.[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“This syrinx was originally not an instrument but a fair [c dimgray]34[/c]
	maiden with a musical voice. She grazed goats, played with
	the Nymphs, and sang as she still does. As she was grazing,
	playing, and singing, Pan approached her and tried to talk
	her into what he wanted by promising to make all her she-goats
	have twins.

	to accept a lover who was not a full-fledged goat or man.

	Pan started to chase her with force in mind. Syrinx started
	running from Pan and his force. When she tired from running,
	she hid in some reeds and vanished into a marsh.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Pan angrily cut away the reeds, could not find the girl,
	realized what had happened to her, and thought of the instrument
	after he had bound reeds together with wax, of
	unequal lengths just as their love had been unequal. And
	what was once a fair maiden is now a musical syrinx.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Lamo had just finished his storytelling, and Philetas [c dimgray]35[/c]
	was complimenting him on telling a story sweeter than
	any song, when Tityrus returned with his father’s syrinx, a
	big instrument with big pipes and decorated with bronze
	where it had been joined with wax.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. One would have
	imagined it was the very one that Pan had originally
	crafted. So Philetas rose and sat upright on a chair, and first
	of all tried the reeds for good air flow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When he was satisfied
	that his breath could pass through unobstructed, he
	began to blow loudly and lustily. One would have thought
	it was multiple pipes playing in unison, so substantial was
	the sound of his playing. Reducing the force by degrees, he
	modulated the tune into a sweeter mode,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. and displaying
	every technique of pastoral musicianship he piped the sort
	of tune that befit a herd of cattle, that suited a flock of
	goats, that was right for sheep. The sheep’s tune was sweet,
	the cattle’s loud, the goat’s shrill. Altogether, a single syrin
	Xrepresented all syrinxes.

	While the others reclined in silent enjoyment, Dryas [c dimgray]36[/c]

	that they seemed to see the grapes, the wine press, the

	So this old man by dancing was the third to win applause, [c dimgray]37[/c]
	and kissed Chloe and Daphnis, who quickly rose
	and danced Lamo’s story. Daphnis took the part of Pan,
	Chloe of Syrinx; he implored her seductively, she smiled
	indifferently.

	2. He gave chase and ran on tiptoe to suggest
	hooves, while she acted the girl tiring in her flight. Then
	Chloe hid in the woods as though in a marsh,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. while
	Daphnis took Philetas’ big syrinx and played a plaintive
	tune as of one in love, an amorous tune as of one wooing,
	and a recall tune as of one in pursuit. Philetas, amazed,
	leapt up and kissed Daphnis, then made him a present of
	the syrinx, and prayed that Daphnis would bequeath it to a
	successor just as good.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He dedicated his own syrinx, the small one, to Pan, [c dimgray]38[/c]
	kissed Chloe as if she were found after a real flight, and
	then drove his herd home, playing his syrinx, since night
	had fallen. And Chloe drove her flock home too, keeping
	them together with the tune of his syrinx.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The goats
	went along beside the sheep and Daphnis walked beside
	Chloe, and so they took their fill of one another until nighttime
	and made a plan to drive their herds down earlier
	than usual the next day, and this they did.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Day was just
	breaking when they came to the pasture. They greeted first
	the Nymphs and then Pan, then sat beneath the oak tree
	and played their syrinxes, and then started kissing, embracing,
	and lying down together, going no farther before
	they got up again. Food was also on their minds, and they
	drank wine mixed with milk.

	Made hotter and bolder by all this, they began to compete [c dimgray]39[/c]
	with one another in a contest of love, and gradually
	went so far as to swear oaths of fidelity. Daphnis went to
	the pine tree and swore by Pan that he would not live alone
	without Chloe, not even for a single day,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. while Chloe
	went into the cave and swore by the Nymphs that all she
	wanted was to live and die with Daphnis. But such was
	Chloe’s girlish simplicity that she came out of the cave and
	demanded from him a second oath. “Daphnis,” she said,
	“Pan is an amorous god and untrustworthy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. He fell in
	love with Pitys, he fell in love with Syrinx, and he never
	stops pestering the Dryads[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c] and bothering the Nymphs
	who watch over the flocks. So if you neglect the oaths you
	swear by him, he will neglect to punish you, even if you
	go after more women than there are reeds in your syrinx.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Swear to me by this herd of goats, and by that she-goat
	who nursed you, never to desert Chloe as long as she stays
	faithful to you. But if she proves wrongful to you and the
	Nymphs, shun her, loathe her, and kill her like a wolf.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Daphnis enjoyed being distrusted. Standing in the middle
	of his flock and grasping a she-goat with one hand and a he-goat
	with the other, he swore to love Chloe as long as she
	loved him, and if ever she preferred another to Daphnis,
	he would kill himself rather than her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. She was delighted
	and trusted him, being a shepherd girl and regarding goats
	and sheep as the special gods of shepherds and goatherds.

	When the Mitylenaeans got word of the attack by the [c dimgray]1[/c]
	ten ships, and some people came from the farms and informed
	them about the plundering, they considered such
	treatment by the Methymnaeans intolerable and resolved
	to take up arms against them immediately.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Enlisting
	three thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry, they dispatched
	their commander Hippasus[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] by land, being wary
	of the sea during the winter.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He did not plunder the Methymnaeans’ farms as he [c dimgray]2[/c]
	marched or seize herds and property from farmers and
	shepherds, regarding that as the conduct of a brigand
	rather than a commander, but rapidly moved on the city
	itself, hoping to breach the gates while they were unguarded.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. When he was some hundred stades[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c] distant a
	herald came to meet him with the offer of a truce.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. For
	the Methymnaeans had learned from the captives that the
	Mitylenaeans knew nothing of what had happened but that
	farmers and shepherds had treated the young men this
	way because of their outrageous behavior. So they began
	to regret their rash action, more impetuous than prudent,
	against a neighboring city and were anxious to return
	all the plunder and resume secure relations by land and

	4. Although Hippasus had been elected commander
	with plenipotentiary authority, he sent the herald on to
	Mitylene while he made camp about ten stades[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] from
	Methymna and awaited orders from his city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Two days
	later, a messenger arrived and instructed him to retrieve
	the plunder and return home without doing any damage.
	Given a choice between war and peace, they found peace
	more profitable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus was resolved the war between Methymna and [c dimgray]3[/c]
	Mitylene, ending as unexpectedly as it began. But for
	Daphnis and Chloe the winter was more bitter than the
	war, for a sudden heavy snowfall had closed all the roads
	and shut in all the farmers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Torrents rushed boisterously
	down and the ice was frozen solid, the trees looked to be
	bent over, the ground was completely invisible except here
	and there around springs and brooks.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. No one drove a
	flock to pasture or ventured outdoors himself, but instead
	built a big fire at cock-crow and spun flax or combed goat
	hair or designed clever bird traps.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. At the same time
	there was thought for the cattle that ate bran at their mangers,
	for the goats and sheep that ate leaves in their pens,
	and for the pigs that ate acorns and mast in their sties.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With everyone thus forced to be housebound, the [c dimgray]4[/c]
	farmers and herdsmen were glad of a short respite from
	their labors, to be eating meals in the morning and sleeping
	in late, so that to them winter seemed sweeter than
	summer and autumn and even spring.

	Daphnis looked back on the joys left behind—how they
	used to kiss, how they used to hug, how they used to take

	3. They felt pangs when a knapsack
	came to hand that they used to eat from, or they caught
	sight of a milk pail that they used to drink from, or a syrin
	Xcasually tossed away that had been a gift of love.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. They
	prayed to the Nymphs and Pan to rescue them from these
	hardships too, and to show them and their flocks some
	sun, and while they prayed they also tried to think of a
	way to see one another.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Chloe was awfully helpless and
	stumped, for her reputed mother was always with her,
	teaching her how to card wool and turn the spindle, and
	mentioning marriage. But Daphnis, who had spare time
	and more sagacity than a girl, came up with the following
	ploy for seeing Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Right in front of Dryas’ farmyard grew two large myrtles [c dimgray]5[/c]
	and an ivy bush, the myrtles close together and the ivy
	between them, so that it spread its tendrils over each of
	them like a vine and with its intertwining leaves formed a
	kind of cave, and many a cluster of berries, as big as grapes,
	hung from the stems.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So there was a crowd of winter
	birds around it, owing to the scarceness of food outside:
	many a blackbird, many a thrush, pigeons and starlings and
	every other winged ivy-eater.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Daphnis set out on the
	pretext of hunting these birds, filling his knapsack with
	honeyed tidbits and packing birdlime and snares to add
	credibility.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Although the trip was no longer than ten
	stades,[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] the still unmelted snow made considerable work

	for him. But love finds a way through everything, be it fire,
	water, or Scythian snow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So he made tracks for the farmyard and, after shaking [c dimgray]6[/c]
	the snow off his legs, set his snares, daubed long sticks with
	his birdlime, and sat down waiting for birds and thinking
	anxiously of Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Plenty of birds came, and enough
	were caught that he was endlessly busy collecting, killing,
	and plucking them, but no one emerged from the farmhouse,
	not man, lass, or domestic fowl; instead, everyone
	was shut up indoors, staying close to the fire, so that
	Daphnis grew very baffled, wondering if he had come for
	birds of ill omen, and was working up the courage to find
	some pretext to barge through the door and asking himself
	what would sound most plausible.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. “I came to get a light
	for the fire”: “Why? Weren’t there neighbors just a stade
	away?” “I’m here to ask for some bread”: “But your knapsack
	is full of food.” “I need some wine”: “You did have
	your vintage just the other day.” “A wolf was after me”:
	“Then where are the wolf’s tracks?” “I’m here to catch the
	birds”: “Well, now that you’ve caught them, why aren’t you
	leaving?” “I want to see Chloe”:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. “Who admits such a
	thing to a girl’s father and mother?” Tripped up on every
	side, he thought “not one of these is above suspicion, so
	better to keep quiet. I will see Chloe in the spring, since
	I’m apparently not meant to see her during the winter.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Reaching these conclusions, without a word he collected
	what he had caught and had just begun his return trip

	carved, bread passed, the wine bowl mixed. One of the
	sheepdogs, watching until no one was looking, snatched
	some meat and ran out the door.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Dryas, annoyed because
	it was his portion, grabbed a stick and followed its
	tracks like a dog. The chase had brought him to the ivy
	when he saw Daphnis with his catch on his shoulders and
	intent on scurrying away.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. He forgot all about the meat
	and the dog, loudly cried “Hello there, boy!” and hugged
	him, gave him a kiss, took <his hand>, and led him into
	the house. When they saw one other they nearly sank to
	the ground, but managing to stay upright they exchanged
	greetings and kisses, and this served as a support to keep
	them from collapsing.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So Daphnis got more than he hoped for: both a kiss [c dimgray]8[/c]
	and Chloe. He settled by the fire, unloaded the pigeons
	and blackbirds from his shoulders onto the table, and told
	them how, sick of being housebound, he had gone out to
	hunt and caught some of them with snares and others with
	birdlime as they went after the myrtle berries and the
	ivy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They applauded his energy and invited him to eat
	some of what the dog had left behind, and asked Chloe to
	pour them drinks. She gladly served the others first and
	Daphnis last, since she was pretending to be angry that he
	had come and meant to run off without seeing her. All the
	same, she took a sip before serving him, then gave it to him
	just so. And though he was thirsty he drank slowly, by slowness
	affording himself longer pleasure.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The table was soon empty of bread and meat, but they [c dimgray]9[/c]
	remained sitting and asked after Myrtale and Lamo, and

	2. He was delighted enough by these compliments
	in Chloe’s hearing, but when they pressed him to
	stay because they were going to make a sacrifice for Dionysus
	the next day, he was so delighted he nearly made obeisance
	to them instead of Dionysus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. So he promptly produced
	from his knapsack a great many honey cakes and the
	birds he had caught, and they set about preparing these for
	the evening meal.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Another wine bowl was set up and another
	fire lit, and after a very early nightfall they did justice
	to the second table and then told stories and sang songs until
	they went to bed, Chloe with her mother, Dryas with
	Daphnis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. For Chloe there was no gain except that tomorrow
	Daphnis would be there to see, while Daphnis was
	pleased with an empty pleasure, for he considered it pleasurable
	even to sleep beside Chloe’s father, so that he
	hugged and kissed him again and again, dreaming that he
	was doing all this to Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When day came it was extraordinarily cold, and a northerly [c dimgray]10[/c]
	wind was parching everything. They got up and sacrificed
	a yearling ram to Dionysus, then built a big fire and
	began to prepare a meal.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. While Nape was baking bread
	and Dryas was boiling the ram, Daphnis and Chloe used
	the free time to go outside the farmyard to where the ivy
	was, and once again placing snares and daubing birdlime,
	they managed to catch no small number of birds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. And
	they had the pleasure of continuous kissing and the enjoyment
	of conversation. “It was because of you that I came,
	Chloe.” “I know, Daphnis.” “It’s because of you that I’m
	killing the poor blackbirds.” “So what do you want me
	to do?” “Remember me.” “I do remember you, by the
	Nymphs I once swore by when I entered that cave, where

	4. “But there’s a lot of
	it, Chloe, and I’m afraid I will melt before the snow does.”
	“Take heart, Daphnis, the sun is hot.” “If only it were as
	hot, Chloe, as the flame that burns this heart of mine.”
	“You’re beguiling me.” “I’m not, so help me those goats
	that you told me to swear by.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Chloe responded this way to Daphnis like an echo, [c dimgray]11[/c]
	then when Nape and the others called them they ran inside,
	bringing a much bigger catch than yesterday’s. They
	poured from the bowl first to Dionysus, and ate their meal
	with their heads crowned with ivy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. When the time came,
	they cried “Iacchus” and “Evoe,”[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] filled Daphnis’ knapsack
	with meat and bread, and saw him on his way. They
	also gave him the pigeons and thrushes to take to Lamon
	and Myrtale, saying that they would catch others themselves
	as long as the winter lasted and the ivy did not run
	out.

	3. He took his leave, kissing them before Chloe, so
	that her kiss would remain pure. He made many other
	trips on various pretexts, and so their winter was not entirely
	without love.

	Now spring was beginning, the snow was melting, the [c dimgray]12[/c]
	earth was being uncovered, and the grass was beginning to
	grow. The herdsmen drove their flocks to pasture, Daphnis
	and Chloe before the others, since they were servants of a
	greater shepherd.

	2. They ran straight to the Nymphs in
	the cave, then to Pan by the pine, then to the oak tree,
	where they sat grazing their flocks and exchanging kisses.
	Wishing to make garlands for the gods, they also looked for

	by what they heard and melted away at what they
	saw, and they too tried to find for themselves something

	He pressed Chloe to give him all that he wanted and to [c dimgray]14[/c]
	lie together naked for longer than they used to before,
	since this was the last untried step in Philetas’ instructions,
	so that the sole antidote for love could take effect.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. She asked what more there was than kissing, hugging, and actually
	lying down, and what he meant to do once they were
	lying together naked. “What the rams are doing to the
	ewes,” he replied, “and the he-goats to the she-goats.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Do
	you notice that after they do that, the females no longer
	run away from the males and the males no longer wear
	themselves out chasing the females, but instead they graze
	together afterwards as if having shared a mutual pleasure?
	Apparently this behavior has a sweetness that overcomes
	the bitterness of love.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. “Don’t you also notice, Daphnis,
	that the rams and the he-goats stand when they do this, and
	the ewes and the she-goats stand when they have it done,
	the males hopping onto the females and the females carrying
	them on their backs? And you ask me to lie down with
	you, and naked to boot? Yet how much woollier these females
	are than I am, even with my clothes on!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Daphnis
	agreed. Reclining with her, he lay there a long time, and
	not knowing how to do any of what he grew taut for, he
	stood her up and clung to her from behind, imitating the
	he-goats. But much more frustrated than before, he sat
	down and started to weep, for being more inept than he-goats
	in making love.

	2. Seeing Daphnis every day as he drove his goats down to
	pasture in the morning and drove them back in the evening,
	she conceived a desire to acquire him as a lover by
	enticing him with presents.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. One day she waylaid him
	when he was by himself and gave him a syrinx, honey in the
	comb, and a deerskin knapsack, but divining his love for
	Chloe, she hesitated to say anything; she observed that he
	was completely devoted to the girl.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. In fact she had already
	guessed as much by their nods and laughter. But
	early that morning, pretending to Chromis that she was off
	to visit a neighbor who was having a baby, she had tailed
	them and, hiding in a copse so as not to be seen, overheard
	everything they said and saw everything they did; not even
	Daphnis’ weeping did she miss.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. She felt sorry for the
	poor couple and thought she had a double opportunity: to
	come to their rescue and serve her own desire as well. She
	came up with the following scheme.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The next day, pretending to be off to visit the woman [c dimgray]16[/c]
	who was having a baby, she showed up openly at the oak
	tree where Daphnis and Chloe were sitting and gave an accurate
	impression of a woman in distress:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “Come to my
	rescue, Daphnis,” she said, “I’m in a sorry state. An eagle
	snatched one of my twenty geese, the best one, and it
	was such a big load to carry that he couldn’t get aloft and
	bring it to his usual high rock over there, but crashed into
	these woods down here still holding it.

	you will kill the eagle too, and it will no longer be snatching
	lots of your lambs and kids. Chloe will look after your flock
	while you’re gone. The goats must know her, since she is always
	grazing with you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So having no suspicion of what was about to happen, [c dimgray]17[/c]
	Daphnis got right up, picked up his crook, and followed
	behind Lycaenium. She led him as far away from Chloe as
	she could, and when they were in the thickest woods she
	told him to sit down by a spring and said, “Daphnis, you are
	in love with Chloe. I was told this by the Nymphs last night.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. In a dream they described to me those tears of yours yesterday
	and bid me to come to the rescue by teaching you
	how to make love. It isn’t merely kissing and hugging and
	what rams and he-goats do. It’s a different kind of frolicking,
	sweeter than theirs, because the pleasure it brings
	lasts longer.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. If you really want to be rid of your troubles
	and have a go at the delights that you’re after, come on,
	give your \[delightful\] self to me as a pupil, and as a favor to
	these Nymphs I will teach you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In his delight Daphnis could not resist, but country [c dimgray]18[/c]
	goatherd that he was, young and in love, he fell at
	Lycaenium’s feet and begged her to teach him as soon as
	possible the skill that he wanted to use on Chloe.

	2. As if
	about to learn something truly great and heaven-sent, he
	promised to give her a kid weaned in the fold, soft cheeses
	made from a she-goat’s first milking, and the she-goat herself.

	expected, Lycaenium began to educate Daphnis in the following
	way. She told him to sit beside her just as he was and
	to give her the same kind and number of kisses as usual,
	and as he kissed her, to put his arms around her and lie
	down on the ground.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So Daphnis sat down, kissed her,
	and lay down, and when she felt him distended and ready
	for action, she raised him from where he lay on his side,
	skillfully slipped under him, and guided him into the passage
	he had been looking for so long. From that point she
	had to make no extra effort: nature herself taught what was
	to be done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When his lesson in love was over, Daphnis, still thinking [c dimgray]19[/c]
	like a shepherd, was eager to run to Chloe and do everything
	he had learned right away, as if afraid that he would
	forget if he delayed. But Lycaenium held him back with
	these words: “There is something more you should know,
	Daphnis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Because I’m a mature woman, this didn’t hurt
	at all; long ago another man taught me this lesson and took
	my virginity as his reward. But when Chloe has this sort of
	wrestling match with you, she will scream and cry and lie
	bleeding heavily \[as if murdered\].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. But don’t be afraid of
	the blood, though when you convince her to surrender
	herself to you, bring her to this spot so that if she yells no
	one will hear it, if she weeps no one will see it, and if she
	bleeds she can wash in the spring. And just remember that
	I made you a man before Chloe did.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Leaving him with this advice, Lycaenium went off to a [c dimgray]20[/c]
	different part of the woods, saying that she was still looking
	for her goose, while Daphnis mulled over what she had
	said and abandoned his previous impulse. He was reluctant

	did not want her shouting at him as if he were an enemy, or
	weeping as if in pain, or bleeding as if murdered.

	2. This
	was the first he had heard about the blood and he was
	frightened, believing that surely blood comes only from a
	wound. Having resolved to go on enjoying himself with her
	in the usual ways, he left the woods and when he came to
	where she sat plaiting a little garland of violets, he made up
	a story about snatching the goose from the eagle’s talons,
	and then hugged her and kissed her the way he had kissed
	Lycaenium at the height of his pleasure: that he could do
	without risk.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. She fitted the garland on his head and
	kissed his hair, saying it was better than the violets, then
	produced from her knapsack a piece of fruitcake and some
	bread and gave it to him to eat. What he ate she snatched
	from his mouth and ate it like a baby bird.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While they were eating, and doing more kissing than [c dimgray]21[/c]
	eating, a fishing boat came into view as it sailed by. There
	was no wind and the sea was calm, so they had decided to
	row and were rowing hard, since they were in a hurry to
	deliver some newly caught fish to a certain rich man in the
	city while it was fresh.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. As they pulled their oars they did
	what sailors typically do to take their minds off their toil:
	one, acting as boatswain, sang sea shanties while the others
	piped up in unison, like a chorus, at the prompting of his
	voice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. As long as they did this on the open sea, the noise
	vanished as their voices were dispersed over an expanse of
	air, but when they rounded a given cape and rowed into a
	crescent-shaped and hill-rimmed bay, the noise was amplified
	and the boatswains’ shanties carried clearly to the
	land.

	3. Pan grew angry
	with the girl, being jealous of her music and unsuccessful
	at winning her beauty. He afflicted the shepherds and
	goatherds with madness, and they tore her apart like dogs
	or wolves and scattered her limbs, still singing, over all the
	earth.

	4. As a favor to Nymphs, Earth hid all her limbs and
	preserved their music, and by will of the Muses, she has a

	he jumps up and chases over the hills, yearning only to

	that he told no lies.

	2. Nape was elated by the prospects; her advice was to marry
	Chloe off and not to keep a girl her age at home any longer,
	when pretty soon she would lose her maidenhood in the
	pasture and make a man of some shepherd in return for
	apples or roses. No, they should make her mistress of a
	household, get a windfall for themselves, and put it aside
	for their own natural child (a male child had been born
	to them not long before).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. There were moments when
	Dryas was tempted by her rationale, since the gifts promised
	by each suitor exceeded the norm for a shepherd girl,
	but at other moments he thought that this maiden was too
	good for rustic suitors, and if she ever found her real parents
	she would make his family very well off. So he delayed
	his reply and played for time, and in the meantime he
	made no small profit in gifts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When she heard about this
	she had a miserable time and managed to keep it from
	Daphnis for quite a while, not wanting to make him miserable.
	But he was insistent and pressed her for answers, and
	was more miserable not knowing than he would be if he
	knew, so she told him everything: that she had many rich
	suitors, the arguments Nape was using in her eagerness for
	the wedding, that Dryas had not said no but had put off his
	decision until the grape harvest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At this Daphnis became distraught. He sat down and [c dimgray]26[/c]
	burst into tears, saying that he would die if Chloe no longer
	grazed with him, and the sheep along with him, without
	such a shepherdess. Then he recovered and began to take
	heart, formed a plan to win over her father, started counting
	himself as one of the suitors, and was confident that he

	hand, and Chloe thought so too. He dared say nothing to
	Lamo but found the courage to reveal his love to Myrtale
	and to broach the subject of marriage, and that night she
	shared this with Lamo.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. He adamantly rejected her advocacy
	and upbraided her for thinking to make a match between
	the daughter of shepherds and their son, who by his
	tokens was destined for great things and who, should he
	find his own family, would make the two of them free and
	masters of a larger spread. Because love was involved,
	Myrtale feared that if Daphnis’ hope of marriage were
	completely disappointed he would do something lethal, so
	she gave him a different account of the rejection:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. “We
	are poor people, my son, and look for a bride who will add
	some value, while they are rich and looking for rich bridegrooms.
	So come on, you convince Chloe, and get her to
	convince her father, to consent to the marriage without
	asking for a lot. I’m sure she loves you too and would rather
	sleep with a poor man who’s handsome than a monkey
	who’s rich.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Never expecting that Dryas would agree to this proposal [c dimgray]27[/c]
	as long as he had richer suitors, Myrtale thought that
	she had begged off the marriage in a plausible way, while
	Daphnis could find no fault with what she said. But falling
	far short of what he had asked, he did what penurious
	lovers usually do: he started to cry and appealed to the
	Nymphs once again for help.

	appeared to him in the same guise as before, and again it

	3. The young Methymnaeans’ boat, whose
	willow shoot your goats ate up, was blown far from land
	that day, but during the night an onshore wind churned the
	sea and the boat was cast ashore on the rocks of the cape.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The boat itself and most of its cargo were destroyed, but
	a purse containing three thousand drachmas was tossed up
	by the surf and is lying covered with seaweed beside a dead
	dolphin, so that no passerby has gone anywhere near it but
	gives it a wide berth because of the stench of the putrefaction.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. But you approach it, and when you get there, retrieve
	it, and when you have retrieved it, make a present of

	This said, they vanished with the night. At daybreak [c dimgray]28[/c]
	Daphnis jumped up in high spirits and whistled loudly as
	he drove his goats to pasture. He gave Chloe a kiss and paid
	homage to the Nymphs, then went down to the sea as if
	wanting to have a splash and walked along the sand beside
	the breakers in search of the three thousand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. And apparently
	it would not take much effort, for the unpleasant
	odor of the beached and rotting dolphin assaulted him.
	Using its putrefaction to guide his way, he went straight
	to it, removed the seaweed, and found the purse full of
	money.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This he retrieved and put in his knapsack, and
	did not leave before praising the Nymphs’ name and the
	sea itself, for though he was a goatherd he now thought the
	sea sweeter than the land, since it was the sea helping him
	marry Chloe.

	With the three thousand in hand he waited no longer, [c dimgray]29[/c]
	but feeling that he was the richest not only of the farmers
	there but of all mankind, he went straight to Chloe, told
	her about his dream, showed her the purse, told her to look
	after the flocks until he got back, and bounded away to see
	Dryas. He found him with Nape threshing some grain and
	launched into a very bold proposal of marriage:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. “Give
	me Chloe as my wife. I know how to make a good harvest,
	prune a vine, and plant trees. I know how to till the ground
	and winnow in a wind, and Chloe can witness how I graze a
	flock. I had fifty she-goats when I took over and doubled
	their number. I have also raised nice big he-goats, where
	before we used to mate our she-goats with other people’s
	he-goats.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Furthermore, I am young and a faultless
	neighbor to you, and a she-goat nursed me just as a ewe
	nursed Chloe. In all this I outdo the others, and I will not
	be beaten when it comes to gifts either:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. they will offer
	goats and sheep, a pair of mangy oxen, and grain that
	couldn’t even keep hens alive, while from me here’s three
	thousand for you. One thing: no one must know about this,
	not even my own father Lamo.” As he made the gift, he
	hugged and kissed him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At the unexpected sight of so much money they promised [c dimgray]30[/c]
	on the spot to give him Chloe and undertook to persuade
	Lamo.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Nape stayed there with Daphnis, driving
	the oxen around and grinding the ears of corn under the
	threshing boards, while Dryas stored the purse where the
	tokens were kept and then hurried off to see Lamo and
	Myrtale, intending something very novel: to ask for their
	son’s hand in marriage.

	that it was a common complaint everywhere.

	4. Then
	he asked for Daphnis as a husband for Chloe, saying that
	while others were making large offers, he would accept
	nothing from them; instead, he would give Lamo and
	Myrtale some of his own property. After all, they had been
	brought up together and while grazing had been bonded
	by an affection that could not be easily broken; and now
	they were of an age to go to bed together.

	5. He made these
	arguments and then some, as was natural for one whose
	prize for persuasion was three thousand. As an excuse
	Lamo could no longer plead poverty, since the other couple
	were not looking down on them, or Daphnis’ age, since
	he was now a young man. Even so, he did not voice his true
	feeling, that Daphnis was too good for such a marriage, but
	after a brief silence he gave this answer:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“You are right to value neighbors over strangers and [c dimgray]31[/c]
	not to think wealth better than honest poverty. For that
	may Pan and the Nymphs cherish you.

	3. Besides, Chloe is
	much sought after too: she’s a fine young girl and good at
	everything. But since I’m a slave without any authority
	over my affairs, my master has to be informed about this
	and give his consent. So look, let’s postpone the wedding

	for now they must love one another like brother and sister.
	Here’s one thing you should know, Dryas: the young man
	that you’re promoting is a cut above the likes of us.” With
	that, he kissed him and offered him a drink, for it was now
	high noon, and then walked him part of the way home,
	showing complete friendliness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Dryas had not listened idly to Lamo’s last remark, and [c dimgray]32[/c]
	as he walked home he reflected about who Daphnis really
	was. “He was nursed by a she-goat, as if the gods cared
	about him. He’s handsome and nothing like that pugnosed
	old man and his balding wife. He got hold of three
	thousand, an amount a goatherd isn’t likely to have even of
	wild pears.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Did someone expose him too, like Chloe?
	Did Lamo find him just as I found her? Were there tokens
	beside him like the ones I found? If this turns out to be
	true—and may it happen that way, master Pan and dear
	Nymphs—maybe when he discovers his own relations he
	will discover something about Chloe’s mysterious circumstances
	too.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. These were his reflections and daydreams
	all the way back to the threshing floor. When he got there,
	he bucked up Daphnis, who was anxiously awaiting the
	news, by addressing him as son-in-law, and promised that
	he would celebrate the wedding in autumn and, shaking
	his hand, that Chloe would belong to no one but Daphnis.

	So quicker than a thought, and without stopping to eat [c dimgray]33[/c]

	pails, set the cheeses into baskets to harden, and put the
	lambs and kids under their mothers. When all this was in
	order, they had something to eat and drink, then walked
	about in search of ripe fruit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. There was a great abundance
	of it, since this was the most productive time of year:
	there were plenty of wild pears, plenty of cultivated pears,
	plenty of apples, some already fallen and some still on the
	trees. Those on the ground were more fragrant, those on
	the boughs more splendid; the former smelled like wine,
	the latter gleamed like gold.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. One tree had been picked
	and wore neither fruit nor leaves; all of its boughs were
	bare. And one apple was ripening on its very topmost
	branches, a large fine one whose splendor by itself outshone
	many others put together. The picker had been
	afraid to climb up there and did not care to take it down.
	And maybe a fine apple was being reserved for a shepherd
	in love.[c dimgray][sup]44[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Daphnis spotted this apple he was eager to climb [c dimgray]34[/c]
	up and pick it, and he ignored Chloe when she tried to stop
	him. Angry at being ignored, she went back to her flocks,
	while Daphnis climbed up and achieved his goal of picking
	the apple and bringing it to Chloe as a present. He spoke to
	her, angry as she was, this way: “Dear girl, fine seasons begot
	this apple, a fine tree nourished it under a ripening sun,
	and chance looked after it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. As long as I had eyes to see, I
	was not about to abandon it to fall to the ground, where a
	flock would trample it or a snake poison it or time waste it
	as it sat there being looked at and praised. This is what
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]44[/sup][/c]This episode recalls a famous wedding song by Sappho (fr.
	105a): for her bridegroom the bride has kept intact her virginity “like a sweet apple ripening on the topmost bough, atop the very
	topmost, where the apple pickers have overlooked it, or no, not
	overlooked but were unable to reach it.”

	he put the apple into her bosom. As he came close, she
	kissed him, so Daphnis did not regret daring to climb up so
	high: he got a kiss that was better even than a golden apple.

	One of Lamo’s fellow slaves arrived from Mitylene with [c dimgray]1[/c]
	the news that the master would be coming shortly before
	the vintage to find out whether the Methymnaeans’ raid
	had done any damage to his lands.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Now that summer was
	on its way out and autumn on its way in, Lamo began to
	make his accommodations a pleasure to behold in every
	way.

	3. He cleaned out the springs so that their water
	would be clean, carted the dung from the yard so that its
	odor would not offend, and attended the park so that it
	would look beautiful.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The park was a thing of consummate beauty even by [c dimgray]2[/c]
	comparison with royal parks.[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c] It was one stade long,[c dimgray][sup]47[/sup][/c] lay
	on high ground, and was four plethra wide.[c dimgray][sup]48[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. One would
	have compared it to a small plain. It had all sorts of trees:
	apple, myrtle, pear, pomegranate, fig, and olive. On one
	side was a towering vine that overspread the apple and
	pear trees, its grapes darkening as if competing with them
	in a contest of fruit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. These were the cultivated trees.
	There were also cypresses, bays, planes, and pines. To
	match the grape vine, ivy overspread all these, its large
	darkening berries mimicking bunches of grapes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. The
	fruit trees were on the inside as if under protection, and

	and each trunk stood apart from its neighbor, while overhead
	the boughs met and entwined their foliage. Even
	their natural growth looked like a work of art.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. There
	were flowerbeds too, some produced by the earth, others
	by art: roses, hyacinths, and lilies were the work of human
	hands, while the earth produced violets, daffodils, and
	pimpernels. There was shade in summer, flowers in spring,
	grapes for picking in autumn, and fruit in every season.

	From this point there was a good view of the plain, [c dimgray]3[/c]
	where those grazing their flocks could be seen, and a good
	view of the sea, where those sailing along the coast were
	in view, so that all this too was an aspect of the park’s luxuriousness.
	At the very center of the park’s length and
	breadth was a shrine and altar of Dionysus; ivy covered the
	altar, vine shoots the temple.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Inside, the temple had

	Ariadne asleep,[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] Lycurgus in chains,[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c] Pentheus being

	and Etruscans having their shapes changed;[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c] everywhere
	were satyrs <treading grapes>, everywhere maenads dancing.

	Nor was Pan neglected: he was there too, sitting on a
	rock and playing the syrinx as if providing the music for
	both the treaders and the dancers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This was the park that Lamo started to put in order, cutting [c dimgray]4[/c]
	away the dry wood, tying up the vine shoots. He put
	a garland on Dionysus, and watered the flowers from a
	spring that Daphnis had discovered for the flowers: Lamo
	tended the flowers

	2. and also urged Daphnis to fatten the
	goats as much as he could, saying that the master would
	surely inspect them, since he had not visited for so long.

	3. Daphnis felt confident that he would be complimented
	on that score: he had doubled the number that he had
	taken over, no wolf had snatched even one, and they were
	fatter than the sheep. But wanting the master to be enthusiastic
	for his marriage, he treated them with complete
	care and attention, driving them out very early in the
	morning and driving them back early in the evening.

	4. He
	led them to drink twice a day and looked for the best grazing
	spots. He took care to have new bowls, plenty of milk
	pails, and larger cheese baskets, and he was so attentive
	that he was even oiling their horns and combing their hair:

	Chloe shared in all this work on them, neglecting her own

	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. So they very welcomingly welcomed this man
	Eudromus,[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] for that was his name, meaning that running
	was his job, and all the while kept on with the vine-stripping,
	taking the bunches to the presses, drawing off the
	new wine into the jars, and setting aside the prime bunches
	on the stem so that their visitors from the city too could
	experience the look and pleasure of a grape harvest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Eudromus was ready to hustle back to town, [c dimgray]6[/c]
	Daphnis gave him a number of gifts, including the kind of
	gifts supplied by a herd of goats: firm cheeses, a kid born
	late in the year, a white woolly goatskin that he could throw
	on when running in winter.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. He was delighted, kissed
	Daphnis, and promised to put in a good word for him with
	the master. He departed in a friendly mood, while Daphnis
	went on grazing with Chloe in an anxious frame of mind.
	She too was very apprehensive: he was a young man used
	to looking at goats, a mountain, country folk, and Chloe
	and was about to have his first sight of a master who until
	now had been merely a name.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. So she worried for
	Daphnis’ sake about the impression he would make on the
	master, and her heart was troubled by fear that their dream
	of marriage would never come true. So their kissing was
	continuous and their hugs were like fusion, but the kisses
	were timid and the hugs glum, as if the master were already
	there and they were afraid or shy of him. And then
	they were given yet another reason to feel troubled.

	the marriage had already given him lots of gifts.

	2. So when
	he heard that Daphnis would marry her if he got his master’s
	consent, he tried to think of a scheme to turn the master
	against them. Knowing that he took great pleasure in
	the park, he decided to ruin and deface it as much as he
	could.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. If he tried to cut down trees, he would be caught
	because of the noise, so he targeted the flowers for destruction.
	He waited until nightfall, climbed over the wall,
	and dug some up, broke some off, and trampled the rest
	like a pig.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. He got away unnoticed, but when Lamo arrived
	at the garden next morning to irrigate the flowers
	from the spring,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. he saw the whole place devastated,
	more like the work of an enemy than a thief. He tore his tunic
	right off and with a great shout called on the gods.
	Myrtale dropped what she was doing and came running
	out, and Daphnis left his goats and came running up. They
	screamed when they saw it, and wept as they screamed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This mourning for flowers was a novelty, but they were [c dimgray]8[/c]
	weeping in fear of the master, and even a stranger would
	have wept if he had been there: the place was thoroughly
	defaced and now all the ground was muddy, though any
	plant that had escaped the assault still kept some bloom,
	still shone, and still looked beautiful even on the ground.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. The bees too still hung over them, buzzing continuously
	and without letup like mourners. In his shock Lamo even
	said,

	4. Did even
	you, Lord Dionysus, feel no pity for these sorrowful flowers?
	You were their neighbor and used to look at them, and
	many a time I used them to make garlands for you. How
	am I to show my park to the master now? How will he react
	when he sees it? He’ll hang up an old fellow on one of the
	pines like Marsyas,[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c] and maybe Daphnis too, if he thinks

	[m1]\ [/m]
	After this their tears were more vehement, as now they [c dimgray]9[/c]
	were bewailing not the flowers but their own skins. Chloe
	bewailed Daphnis too, at the possibility that he might be
	hung up, and prayed that their master would not come after
	all. The days she endured were as miserable as if she
	could already see Daphnis being flogged.

	elder master would arrive in three days and that his son
	was coming ahead tomorrow.

	3. So they reviewed what had
	happened and included Eudromus in their decision-making.
	Being fond of Daphnis, he advised them to admit everything
	to the young master beforehand and promised to
	help them personally, since he had influence as having

	who had done no wrong; at the same time he told him
	everything.

	2. Astylus was moved to pity by this appeal.
	When he came to the park and saw the destruction of
	the flowers, he promised to intercede with his father and
	blame the horses, telling him that they had been tethered
	there and stampeded when they got loose, breaking down
	some of the flowers, trampling others, and uprooting the
	rest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. For this, Lamo and Myrtale wished him every
	blessing, and Daphnis brought him kids, cheeses, fowl and
	their chicks, grapes on the stem, and apples on the branch.
	Among the gifts was also wine with a floral bouquet: Lesbian
	wine makes the finest drinking.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Astylus expressed his appreciation for these gifts and [c dimgray]11[/c]
	turned his attention to hunting hares, being a wealthy
	young man who spent all his time amusing himself and
	who was in the countryside to enjoy unfamiliar pleasure,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. while Gnatho, being a fellow who knew only eating,
	drinking until he was drunk, and fornicating after he was
	drunk, and who was no more than a mouth, a belly, and
	the parts below the belly, had taken more than a casual
	look at Daphnis when he brought the gifts: having an ingrained
	taste for boys, and having found beauty of a kind
	unknown even in the city, he decided to move on Daphnis
	and thought that a goatherd would be easy to seduce.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. This being the plan, he did not go hunting with Astylus but
	went down to where Daphnis was grazing his herd, to look
	at the goats, he said, but actually to look at Daphnis. To
	soften him up, he complimented the goats and asked him
	to play the goatherd’s tune on the syrinx, and he said that
	he would soon make him a free man, since he had the
	power to make anything happen.

	Sizing up Daphnis as being amenable, he waylaid him [c dimgray]12[/c]
	that evening as he drove his goats back from the pasture.
	First he ran up and gave him a kiss and then asked him to
	present his backside the way she-goats do for he-goats.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. After a while Daphnis caught on and replied that while it
	was fine for he-goats to mount she-goats, no one had ever
	seen a he-goat mounting a he-goat, or a ram mounting a
	ram instead of the ewes, or roosters mounting roosters instead
	of the hens. At this, Gnatho grabbed him and was
	ready to resort to rape,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. but since he was drunk and
	barely able to stand, Daphnis pushed him off and tripped
	him onto the ground, then ran off like a puppy and left him
	lying there needing a man, not a boy, to lend a hand. After
	that, Daphnis allowed him to come nowhere near him, but
	grazed his goats in different places, avoiding him and looking
	after Chloe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Nor did Gnatho interfere with him
	again, having discovered that he was not merely handsome
	but also strong. So he looked for an opportunity to speak
	with Astylus about him, hoping to get him as a gift from the
	young man, who was often willing to do him big favors.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He could not do it just then, for Dionysophanes[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c] was [c dimgray]13[/c]
	arriving with Cleariste,[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] and there was a great hubbub of
	animals, servants, men, and women, but later on he began
	to compose a long speech about love.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Dionysophanes’
	hair was now turning grey, but he was tall, handsome, and
	capable of competing with any young man. Few men were
	as rich, and none as good.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. On the first day of his visit he
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]“Dionysus Manifest.” The name is attested in various
	Greek cities.
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c]“Best Renown.” The name, appropriate for an upper-class
	character, appears twice in Theocritus (2.74, 5.88) but is also
	widely attested as an actual name.

	Pan, and the Nymphs, and set up a wine bowl for everyone
	in attendance to share. The following days he spent
	inspecting Lamo’s work.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. When he saw the plains furrowed,
	the vines in shoot, the park in its beauty (for Astylus
	was taking responsibility for the flowers), he was extraordinarily
	pleased, complimented Lamo, and promised to
	make him a free man.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Then he went down to the goat
	pasture to look at the goats and their goatherd.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Chloe fled into the woods, embarrassed and frightened [c dimgray]14[/c]
	at such a large crowd, but Daphnis stood there with a
	shaggy goatskin around his waist, a newly sewn backpack
	hanging from his shoulders, and both hands full: one held
	freshly set cheeses, the other unweaned kids.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. If ever
	Apollo did herd cattle for Laomedon, he must have looked
	just as Daphnis looked that day.[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c] Daphnis said nothing,
	but blushed deeply and kept his head down as he proffered
	his gifts. It was Lamo who spoke: “Here, master, is the
	herdsman of your goats.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. You gave me fifty to graze, plus
	two he-goats, but he has turned them into one hundred for
	you, plus ten he-goats. Do you see how sleek they are, with
	thick coats and unbroken horns? He has made them musical
	too: when they hear the syrinx they do everything he
	wants.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Cleariste was present for these remarks and was eager [c dimgray]15[/c]
	to put his claim to the test. She asked Daphnis to play his
	syrinx for the goats as usual, and promised to give him a tunic,
	a cloak, and a pair of shoes in appreciation of his playing.

	First he played softly, and the goats stood still and lifted
	their heads. Then he played the grazing tune, and the goats
	lowered their heads and began to graze. Next he struck a
	limpid tone, and all together they lay down.

	3. He piped
	something shrill, and they fled into the woods as if a wolf
	was coming. A little later he sounded the recall, and they
	came out of the woods and assembled at his feet.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. No one
	ever saw even human servants so obedient to a master’s
	command. Everyone was amazed, especially Cleariste,
	who swore that she would come through with the gifts,
	since he was a fine goatherd and musician. They went back
	up to the farmhouse for lunch and sent Daphnis some of
	what they were eating. He shared it with Chloe and enjoyed
	a taste of urban cuisine; and he felt confident that he
	would persuade his masters and win the marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But Gnatho was further inflamed by what had happened [c dimgray]16[/c]
	in the goat pasture and thought his life not worth
	living unless he won Daphnis. So waiting for Astylus to
	take a stroll in the park, he took him into the shrine of Dionysus
	and started kissing his feet and hands.

	2. Astylus
	asked why he was doing this and told him to speak up,
	swearing that he would help him out. “Your Gnatho’s done

	only your table, who used to swear that nothing has a more

	ready for me.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	They agreed on this and went back inside, while Astylus [c dimgray]19[/c]
	sidled up to his father when he was unoccupied and asked
	permission to take Daphnis back to the city, on the grounds
	that he was handsome and too good for the country, and
	could soon be taught urban ways by Gnatho.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. His father
	gladly gave his assent, summoned Lamo and Myrtale, and
	told them the good news that Daphnis would henceforth
	be serving Astylus instead of she-goats and he-goats, and
	promised to give them two goatherds in his place.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. All the slaves were now crowding around, pleased at the prospect
	of having such a handsome fellow slave, when Lamo asked
	permission to speak. “My lord,” he began, “hear a true
	story from an old man; I swear by Pan and the Nymphs that
	I will tell no lies.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. I am not Daphnis’ father, nor has
	Myrtale ever had the luck to be a mother. Other parents
	abandoned this child, perhaps because they had enough
	older children, and I found him exposed and being suckled
	by a she-goat of mine; when she died I buried her in the
	garden around the house, feeling affection because she
	had done a mother’s job.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. I also found recognition tokens
	exposed with him: I admit I did, master, and I have kept
	them safe, because they are signs of circumstances higher
	than ours. So while I do not consider him too good to be
	Astylus’ slave, a handsome servant for a handsome and
	good master, I cannot stand by and watch him be used for
	the drunken enjoyment of Gnatho, who is eager to take
	him to Mitylene for service as a woman.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With this Lamo fell silent and wept copiously, while [c dimgray]20[/c]
	Gnatho kept up a bold front and threatened to beat him.

	with a severe frown told Gnatho to be quiet. He began to
	question Lamo again, and warned him to tell the truth and
	fabricate no mythic tales in order to keep hold of his son.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But Lamo stuck to his story, swore by all the gods, and
	offered himself for torture to show if he was lying. So with
	Cleariste sitting at his side, Dionysophanes examined the
	testimony. “Why should Lamo lie when he stands to get
	two goatherds for one? How could a yokel make this up? In
	fact, was it not incredible from the very start that such a
	handsome son could have sprung from this sort of old man
	and shabby mother?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It seemed best to stop guessing and examine the tokens [c dimgray]21[/c]
	now, to see if they bespoke an illustrious and more distinguished
	station. Myrtale went off to bring all the items,
	which were kept in an old knapsack,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. and when they arrived
	Dionysophanes was the first to start looking through
	them. When he saw a little purple mantle, a golden clasp,
	and a little sword with an ivory hilt, he loudly shouted
	“Lord Zeus!” and told his wife to come look.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When she
	saw them, she herself loudly shouted “Dear Fates! Aren’t
	these the things we left with our own child? Isn’t this the
	farm where we told Sophrosyne[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c] to take him? They’re
	none other than those very things. Dear husband, the child
	is ours. Daphnis is your son, and he was tending his father’s
	goats!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While she was still speaking and Dionysophanes was [c dimgray]22[/c]

	to give Daphnis a kiss.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. When Daphnis saw him running
	with a great throng and crying “Daphnis!”, he thought he
	was running because he wanted to carry him off. He tossed
	his knapsack and his syrinx away and headed for the sea to
	throw himself from the big rock.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. And Daphnis, by a most
	strange turn, might have been lost because he was found,
	had Astylus not understood and cried out again: “Hold on,
	Daphnis, don’t be afraid! I am your brother and your masters
	up till now are your parents!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. Lamo has just now told
	us about the she-goat and showed us the tokens. Turn
	around and look how they come beaming and laughing.
	Come on, give me the first kiss! I swear by the Nymphs that
	I’m not lying.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At this oath Daphnis reluctantly held up and waited [c dimgray]23[/c]
	for Astylus to run to him, and gave him a kiss when he
	came up. While he was kissing him, the rest of the throng
	streamed up, servants, maids, his father himself and his
	mother with him. Everyone hugged and kissed him, rejoicing
	and weeping.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. But he embraced his father and
	mother before anyone else, and hugged them to his breast
	as if he had known them all along, and did not want to leave
	their embraces: so quickly does nature convince us! For a
	moment he even forgot about Chloe and returned to the
	house, where he donned expensive clothes and sat by his
	proper father to hear the story that he told.

	“My sons, I married quite young, and after a while I [c dimgray]24[/c]
	became a happy father, or so I thought. First I had a son,
	second a daughter, and third was Astylus. I thought my
	family was large enough, and when this child came along
	on top of all the others I abandoned him, leaving these
	things with him not as tokens of identity but as funeral offerings.

	daughter perished of the same illness in a single day, but
	you were saved by the gods’ providence so that we would
	have more hands to support us.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Please, never bear a

	please bear no resentment that you will receive a portion of
	my wealth instead of the whole: for sensible people, no
	possession is greater than a brother. Come, love one another,

	servants, gold, silver, everything else that fortunate people
	possess. Only I award this place exclusively to Daphnis,

	said, “You were right to remind me, father: I’m off to take

	around for that syrinx of mine while I’m sitting here.”

	2. They all had a pleasant laugh to think that though he had
	become a master he was still a goatherd. Someone else was
	sent to look after the goats, while they all made sacrifice to
	Zeus the Savior and got busy preparing a party. Gnatho
	was the only one who did not attend this party: he was
	frightened and spent the whole day and night in the shrine
	of Dionysus like a suppliant.

	Dionysophanes kept them all there to share his good [c dimgray]26[/c]
	cheer and then his feast. Wine was provided in abundance,
	as was wheat-meal bread, waterfowl, suckling pigs, assorted
	honeycakes; and many victims were sacrificed to
	the local divinities.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Now Daphnis collected all of his pastoral
	possessions and distributed them among the gods as
	dedications. To Dionysus he dedicated his knapsack and
	his goatskin, to Pan his syrinx and his transverse flute, to
	the Nymphs his staff and the milk pails that he had made
	himself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. What is familiar so truly gives more pleasure
	than alien prosperity that Daphnis wept over each of these
	possessions as he parted with it, and he did not dedicate
	the pails until he had done the milking, nor the goatskin
	before he had put it on, nor the syrinx before he had played
	it,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. but he actually kissed them all, said a word to the she-goats,
	and called the he-goats by name. He also drank from
	the spring, as many a time he had done with Chloe. But he
	did not as yet reveal his love, waiting for the right moment.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While Daphnis was busy with sacrifices, this is what [c dimgray]27[/c]
	was happening with Chloe. She sat weeping, grazing her
	sheep, and saying what could be expected: “Daphnis has
	forgotten me. He is dreaming of a wealthy marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Why did I make him swear by the she-goats instead of the
	Nymphs? He has deserted them as he has deserted Chloe.
	Not even when he was sacrificing to the Nymphs and Pan
	did he feel any desire to see Chloe. Maybe he has found
	maids in his mother’s service who are better than me.
	Good-bye to him! I won’t go on living.”

	and though he dared not speak to his father, he could not

	How much happier as a slave! Then I could look at Chloe,

	Gnatho, who was hiding in the park, overheard [c dimgray]29[/c]

	of Chloe in his arms, Daphnis reconciled with Gnatho as
	with a benefactor, and apologized to Chloe for his neglect.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In discussing the situation, they decided that Daphnis [c dimgray]30[/c]
	should hide his intended marriage and take Chloe in secret,
	confessing his love only to his mother. But Dryas did
	not agree: he asked to speak with Daphnis’ father and
	promised that he himself would persuade him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Next morning, he packed the tokens in his knapsack and visited
	Dionysophanes and Cleariste as they sat in the park;
	Astylus was present, as was Daphnis himself. When they
	were quiet he began his speech:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. “Like Lamo, I am
	forced to tell what has until now gone untold. Chloe here is
	not my daughter and I did not nurse her. She has other parents,
	and a ewe fed her as she lay in a cave of the Nymphs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. I saw this with my own eyes and was amazed at the sight,
	and in my amazement I reared her. Her beauty bears witness,
	for she looks nothing like us, and these tokens bear
	witness too, for they are more valuable than befits a shepherd.
	Look at them and try to find the girl’s relations, in
	case she turns out to be a suitable match for Daphnis.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Dryas did not drop this last comment without purpose [c dimgray]31[/c]
	nor did Dionysophanes listen carelessly. Glancing at
	Daphnis and seeing him turning pale and hiding tears,
	he was quick to sense love. More anxious about his own
	son than someone else’s daughter, he began to test Dryas’
	statements with the utmost exactitude.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. When he saw the
	tokens that had been brought, the gilded sandals, the anklets,
	the headband, he called Chloe to him and told her
	to take heart, because she now had a husband and would
	soon find her father and mother.

	of Chloe and began to dress her for her future role as

	and privately asked whether Chloe was a virgin. When
	Daphnis swore that nothing had happened beyond kisses
	and vows, he was delighted and seated them both at the
	party.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then could be seen what beauty is like when enhanced [c dimgray]32[/c]
	by adornment, for when Chloe had dressed, braided her
	hair, and washed her face, she looked so much comelier
	to everyone that even Daphnis hardly recognized her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Even without the tokens, anyone would have sworn that
	Dryas was not the father of such a girl. Nevertheless, he
	was there too, celebrating with Nape and sharing his own
	couch with Lamo and Myrtale as drinking companions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Over the days that followed, more victims were sacrificed
	and more wine bowls set up, and Chloe dedicated her possessions
	too, her syrinx, her knapsack, her goatskin, her
	milk pails, and she also poured some wine into the spring
	in the cave, because she had been nursed beside it and had
	often bathed in it.

	4. Dryas showed her the ewe’s grave,
	and she placed garlands on it, and as Daphnis had done,
	she played a tune for her flock, and when the tune was finished
	she prayed to the goddesses that she would find the
	ones who had abandoned her and that they would be worthy
	of her marriage to Daphnis.

	When they had their fill of country festivities they decided [c dimgray]33[/c]

	3. Since it was dark when they arrived, they went
	unnoticed by the citizens until the following day, when a
	throng of men and women gathered outside their door.
	The men congratulated Dionysophanes on finding a son,
	especially when they saw how handsome Daphnis was, and
	the women rejoiced with Cleariste at bringing home both
	a son and his bride,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. for Chloe’s unsurpassable beauty
	stunned even them. The whole city was agog for the boy
	and the girl, and were already predicting a happy marriage
	and praying that the girl’s family would be found to be worthy
	of her good looks. Many wives of the wealthiest husbands
	prayed to the gods that they themselves might be
	taken for mothers of such a lovely girl.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Dionysophanes, after much anxious thought, fell into a [c dimgray]34[/c]
	deep sleep and had the following dream. The Nymphs
	seemed to be asking Love now at last to consent to the
	marriage, and he unstrung his little bow, took off his
	quiver, and told Dionysophanes to invite all the leading citizens
	of Mitylene to a party, and when he filled the last
	wine bowl, to show the tokens to each of them and then
	sing the wedding hymn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. After seeing and hearing this,
	he got up in the morning and ordered a resplendent feast
	prepared with the produce of land and sea, and whatever is
	found in lakes and rivers, and invited as guests all the leading
	citizens of Mitylene.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. When night came and the wine
	bowl was filled for the libation to Hermes,[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c] a servant
	brought in the tokens on a silver tray and took them around
	from left to right for everyone to have a look.

	No one recognized them until a certain Megacles,[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]35[/c]
	who was seated last in order[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c] because of his age, recognized
	them on sight and gave a cry as loud as a young man’s:
	“What’s this I see? What has become of you, my little
	daughter? Are you still alive too, or did some shepherd find
	only these and pick them up?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Please tell me, Dionysophanes,
	how did you come by my child’s tokens? After
	discovering Daphnis, don’t begrudge me my own discovery!”
	But Dionysophanes told him to speak first about the
	abandonment, and without lowering his voice at all he replied,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3.“There was a time when I had little to live on: what
	I had I had spent on fitting out choruses and warships.[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c]
	During that time a daughter came along. Reluctant to raise
	her in poverty, I adorned her with these tokens and abandoned
	her, knowing that many men are eager to become
	fathers even in that way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. So the child was left lying in a
	cave of the Nymphs, entrusted to the goddesses, while for
	me wealth started to pour in day after day, though I had no
	heir.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. For I never had the luck to become a father again,
	even of a daughter, but as if having a laugh at my expense
	the gods kept sending me dreams at night, that a sheep
	would make me a father.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Dionysophanes cried out louder than Megacles and [c dimgray]36[/c]
	leapt from his seat. He brought Chloe in, very beautifully
	decked out, and said, “Here is the child that you abandoned.
	By the gods’ providence a ewe nursed this maiden
	for you, just as a goat nursed Daphnis for me.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Take your

	3. Megacles agreed to all
	this. He sent for his wife, Rhoda,[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c] and clasped Chloe to
	his breast. They stayed and slept there, for Daphnis had
	vowed to surrender Chloe to no one, not even her own
	father.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The next day they all decided to drive back into the [c dimgray]37[/c]
	countryside, at the request of Daphnis and Chloe, who
	were unable to bear life in town, and they too thought it
	right to put on a wedding in pastoral style.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. When they
	got to Lamo’s house, they presented Dryas to Megacles
	and Nape to Rhoda, and then began the splendid preparations
	for the feast. Chloe’s father gave her away in the presence
	of the Nymphs and made numerous dedications, including
	her tokens, and he topped up Dryas’ gift to make it
	an even ten thousand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There in front of the cave Dionysophanes spread out [c dimgray]38[/c]
	beds of green leaves, since the weather was fine, had all
	the villagers recline on them, and feasted them lavishly.

	2. In attendance were Lamo and Myrtale, Dryas and Nape,
	Dorco’s family, <Philetas and> Philetas’ sons, Chromis and

	considered worth forgiving.

	like these, everything was agricultural and rustic.
	Someone sang such songs as reapers sing, another cracked

	Lampis played the pipes, Dryas and Lamo performed
	dances, Chloe and Daphnis kept exchanging kisses.

	gave them some green leaves, and held them by their
	horns and gave them kisses.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Not only at that time but for as long as they lived, they [c dimgray]39[/c]
	led for the most part a pastoral life, worshipping Nymphs,
	Pan, and Love as their deities, owning a great many flocks
	of sheep and goats, and considering fruit and milk the
	sweetest food.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. They also put a baby boy to a she-goat,
	and when their second came, a girl, they had her suckle at a
	sheep’s nipple. They called the boy Philopoemen[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c] and the
	girl Agele.[c dimgray][sup]75[/sup][/c] And in this fashion too the children grew old
	with them. They also adorned the cave, dedicated images,

	to dwell in instead of the pine, dubbing him Pan the
	Soldier.[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But it was later that they bestowed these names and [c dimgray]40[/c]
	performed these acts. Now, at nightfall, everyone conducted

	some the pipes, some holding great torches aloft.

	kissed, spending that night more sleepless than any owl.
	Daphnis did some of what Lycaenium had taught him, and
	for the very first time Chloe learned that what had happened
	in the woods was nothing but shepherds’ games.
